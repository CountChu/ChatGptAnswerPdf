## Hypervisor
**Question:** What is hypervisor? (2023-04-06)

**Answer:**

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a type of software that enables the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs) on a physical host machine. The hypervisor is responsible for abstracting the underlying hardware resources of the host and allocating them to the virtual machines, allowing multiple VMs to run simultaneously on a single host.

There are two main types of hypervisors:

1. Type 1 hypervisor (Bare-metal): This type of hypervisor runs directly on the host's hardware without the need for an underlying operating system. It provides strong isolation between VMs and efficiently manages hardware resources. Examples of Type 1 hypervisors include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.

2. Type 2 hypervisor (Hosted): This type of hypervisor runs on top of an existing operating system, which acts as the host. The VMs are created and managed within the host OS. Type 2 hypervisors typically have higher overhead and lower performance compared to Type 1 hypervisors, but they can be easier to set up and manage. Examples of Type 2 hypervisors include VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop.

Hypervisors enable efficient use of computing resources, making it possible to run multiple operating systems and applications on the same physical hardware, improving resource utilization, and enabling greater flexibility in managing workloads. They are widely used in data centers, cloud computing environments, and for virtualization in general.

**Question:** Is TrustZone a hypervisor or virtualization? (2023-04-07)

**Answer:**

TrustZone is neither a hypervisor nor virtualization. TrustZone is a hardware-based security technology developed by ARM. It provides an isolated and secure environment called the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for running sensitive and security-critical applications, alongside the Rich Execution Environment (REE) where the main operating system and applications run.

TrustZone creates two separate worlds - the secure world and the normal world - by partitioning the hardware resources such as processor, memory, and peripherals. The secure world is designed to protect sensitive data and operations, while the normal world runs the typical operating system and applications. The two worlds are isolated at the hardware level, ensuring that security vulnerabilities in the normal world do not compromise the secure world.

In summary, TrustZone is a security feature designed to provide hardware-level isolation for sensitive operations and data, rather than a hypervisor or virtualization technology.

---

**Question:** Is OP-TEE a hypervisor or virtualization? (2023-04-07)

**Answer:**

OP-TEE (Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment) is neither a hypervisor nor virtualization. It is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) designed to work with ARM TrustZone technology. OP-TEE is an open-source software solution that provides a secure environment for running security-critical applications.

When used in conjunction with TrustZone, OP-TEE provides the secure operating system and services that run within the secure world created by TrustZone. It manages access to secure resources and protects sensitive data and operations from unauthorized access in the normal world.

In summary, OP-TEE is a TEE solution that works with TrustZone to provide a secure environment for security-critical applications, rather than a hypervisor or virtualization technology.

**Question:** Does virtualization depend on hypervisor? (2023-04-07)

**Answer:**

Yes, virtualization typically depends on a hypervisor. A hypervisor is a critical component of virtualization technology, as it is responsible for creating, managing, and running virtual machines (VMs) on a physical host system. The hypervisor manages the distribution of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, among the various VMs and provides isolation between them.

There are two types of hypervisors:

1. Type 1 (bare-metal) hypervisors: These hypervisors run directly on the host's hardware, without the need for a host operating system. Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.

2. Type 2 (hosted) hypervisors: These hypervisors run on top of a host operating system and manage virtual machines within the host environment. Examples include Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, and Microsoft Virtual PC.

In both cases, the hypervisor is the key component that enables virtualization, providing the necessary management and isolation between virtual machines running on a single physical host.

---

**Question:** Are there alnatives of hypervisor? (2023-04-07)

**Answer:**

Yes, there are alternatives to hypervisors for creating isolated environments. Some of these alternatives include:

1. Containers: Containers are a lightweight form of virtualization that enables the running of multiple isolated applications on the same host without the need for a full-fledged hypervisor. Containers share the host's kernel and can run directly on the host's operating system, leading to less overhead compared to hypervisors. Examples of container technologies include Docker, LXC, and Kubernetes.

2. Paravirtualization: Paravirtualization is an approach to virtualization where the guest operating system is modified to be aware of the virtualized environment and communicates directly with the host's hardware through a thin layer called the paravirtualization interface. This approach can offer better performance than full virtualization, but it requires modifying the guest operating system, which may not always be feasible. Xen is an example of a paravirtualization platform.

3. Application-level virtualization: Application-level virtualization isolates individual applications rather than entire operating systems, allowing them to run in a sandboxed environment. This can provide isolation and security benefits without the overhead of full-system virtualization. Examples of application-level virtualization include Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which runs Java applications in a sandboxed environment, and Microsoft's .NET runtime.

4. OS-level virtualization: OS-level virtualization provides isolated environments by partitioning a single operating system into multiple isolated instances called zones, jails, or namespaces. Each instance has its own file system, network stack, and process space, but they all share the same kernel. Examples of OS-level virtualization technologies include Solaris Zones, FreeBSD Jails, and Linux namespaces.

These alternatives each have their own advantages and trade-offs, and their suitability depends on the specific use case and requirements of the system being virtualized.

## VM
**Question:** Does VM require hypervisor? (2023-04-07)

**Answer:**

Yes, virtual machines (VMs) typically require a hypervisor to function. A hypervisor is the essential component responsible for creating, managing, and running VMs on a physical host system. It allocates the physical resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, among the VMs and provides isolation between them. VMs are essentially software-based environments running on the hypervisor, which simulates the hardware and allows multiple VMs with different operating systems to share the same physical hardware resources.

There are alternative virtualization technologies, such as containerization (e.g., Docker), which do not rely on a hypervisor but instead use the host operating system's kernel to isolate and manage containers. However, in the context of traditional virtual machines, a hypervisor is a necessary component for their operation.

---

**Question:** Can a VM contain VMs? (2023-04-07)

**Answer:**

Yes, a virtual machine (VM) can contain other VMs, a concept known as nested virtualization. In nested virtualization, a hypervisor runs inside a virtual machine created by another hypervisor. This creates a hierarchy of virtual machines, where the primary hypervisor manages the first-level virtual machines, and the nested hypervisors manage the second-level virtual machines.

Nested virtualization can be useful in various scenarios, such as:

1. Testing and development: Nested virtualization allows developers to test and experiment with different hypervisors and configurations without needing multiple physical machines.
2. Training: Nested virtualization can be used for educational purposes, providing hands-on experience with different virtualization technologies.
3. Cloud environments: Nested virtualization can help cloud providers support customers who want to use their own hypervisors on top of the cloud provider's infrastructure.

However, nested virtualization can also introduce additional overhead and complexity, which can negatively impact the performance of the nested VMs. Additionally, not all hypervisors support nested virtualization, and hardware virtualization support may be required for acceptable performance.

---

## Hypervisor & TrustZone
**Question:** Please compare TrustZone and Hypervisor and also summarize in a table. (2023-04-06)

**Answer:**

TrustZone and hypervisors serve different purposes in providing security and isolation in computer systems, but they can also be complementary. Here's a comparison between the two:

TrustZone:
1. Purpose: Provides hardware-based security and isolation between the secure and non-secure worlds.
2. Scope: Limited to ARM-based systems.
3. Implementation: Built into the ARM processor, enabled by the SoC vendor.
4. Isolation: Creates two separate execution environments (secure world and normal world).
5. Use Cases: Secure boot, key storage, cryptographic operations, and DRM.

Hypervisor:
1. Purpose: Enables the virtualization of multiple operating systems or environments on a single physical host.
2. Scope: Applicable to various processor architectures (x86, ARM, etc.).
3. Implementation: Software-based, can be a Type-1 (bare-metal) or Type-2 (hosted) hypervisor.
4. Isolation: Creates multiple virtual machines (VMs) or containers, each running a separate OS or application.
5. Use Cases: Server consolidation, sandboxing, running multiple OSes on a single device, and cloud computing.

Summary in a table:

| Feature      | TrustZone                | Hypervisor           |
|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Purpose      | Hardware-based security  | Virtualization       |
| Scope        | ARM-based systems        | Multiple platforms   |
| Implementation| Built into ARM processor | Software-based       |
| Isolation    | Secure and normal worlds | Virtual machines/containers |
| Use Cases    | Secure boot, key storage, crypto operations, DRM | Server consolidation, sandboxing, multiple OSes, cloud computing |

Keep in mind that TrustZone and hypervisors can be used together in some cases to enhance the overall security of a system. For example, a TrustZone-enabled secure world can host a secure hypervisor to further isolate and protect sensitive applications.

**Question:** Can hypervisor run in secure world? (2023-04-06)

**Answer:**

Yes, a hypervisor can run in the secure world, but it is less common. Typically, hypervisors run in the normal world, and they manage VMs in the normal world while ensuring their isolation. However, there are secure world hypervisors, like ARM TrustZone-based hypervisors, which are designed to run in the secure world and manage secure partitions or secure VMs.

A secure world hypervisor manages the secure partitions, including OP-TEE, and ensures their isolation from each other and the normal world. In this configuration, OP-TEE acts as one of the secure partitions managed by the secure world hypervisor. This approach allows multiple secure services to coexist in the secure world, each running in its own isolated partition or secure VM.

It's worth mentioning that having a hypervisor in the secure world adds complexity to the system, and its implementation must ensure that it does not introduce vulnerabilities or weaken the security guarantees provided by the secure world.

| 2. Trust boundaries   | Well-defined trust boundaries for secure services     | Trust boundaries managed within the normal world      |
| 3. Resource allocation| Resource constraints due to limited secure world size | More resources available for the hypervisor           |
| 4. Complexity         | Increased development and maintenance complexity      | Simpler development and maintenance process           |
| 5. Attack surface     | Smaller attack surface due to isolation               | Potentially larger attack surface                     |
| 6. Isolation          | Strong isolation between secure and normal world      | Less strict isolation between guest OSs and hypervisor|

---

**Question:** Does TrustZone require hypervisor? (2023-04-09)

**Answer:**

No, TrustZone does not require a hypervisor. TrustZone is a hardware-based security technology implemented in Arm processors that provides a secure execution environment by creating two separate worlds: the Secure World and the Normal World. TrustZone itself is not dependent on a hypervisor.

A hypervisor is a software layer that manages and coordinates multiple virtual machines (VMs) running on a single hardware platform. Hypervisors can be used in conjunction with TrustZone to provide additional isolation and management capabilities for virtualized systems.

While TrustZone and hypervisors can work together, they serve different purposes and are not dependent on one another. TrustZone focuses on providing a secure environment for trusted applications, while hypervisors manage VMs and their resources.
