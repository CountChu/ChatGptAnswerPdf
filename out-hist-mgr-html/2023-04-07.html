</table>
<p>In summary, a hypervisor is a software layer or firmware that enables and manages virtualization. Virtualization, on the other hand, is the process of creating isolated virtual environments on a single physical hardware platform, allowing for more efficient resource utilization, flexibility, and increased security.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[09:05]</code> Is TrustZone a hypervisor or virtualization?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>TrustZone is neither a hypervisor nor virtualization. TrustZone is a hardware-based security technology developed by ARM. It provides an isolated and secure environment called the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for running sensitive and security-critical applications, alongside the Rich Execution Environment (REE) where the main operating system and applications run.</p>
<p>TrustZone creates two separate worlds - the secure world and the normal world - by partitioning the hardware resources such as processor, memory, and peripherals. The secure world is designed to protect sensitive data and operations, while the normal world runs the typical operating system and applications. The two worlds are isolated at the hardware level, ensuring that security vulnerabilities in the normal world do not compromise the secure world.</p>
<p>In summary, TrustZone is a security feature designed to provide hardware-level isolation for sensitive operations and data, rather than a hypervisor or virtualization technology.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[09:06]</code> Is OP-TEE a hypervisor or virtualization?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>OP-TEE (Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment) is neither a hypervisor nor virtualization. It is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) designed to work with ARM TrustZone technology. OP-TEE is an open-source software solution that provides a secure environment for running security-critical applications.</p>
<p>When used in conjunction with TrustZone, OP-TEE provides the secure operating system and services that run within the secure world created by TrustZone. It manages access to secure resources and protects sensitive data and operations from unauthorized access in the normal world.</p>
<p>In summary, OP-TEE is a TEE solution that works with TrustZone to provide a secure environment for security-critical applications, rather than a hypervisor or virtualization technology.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[09:07]</code> Does virtualization depend on hypervisor?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, virtualization typically depends on a hypervisor. A hypervisor is a critical component of virtualization technology, as it is responsible for creating, managing, and running virtual machines (VMs) on a physical host system. The hypervisor manages the distribution of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, among the various VMs and provides isolation between them.</p>
<p>There are two types of hypervisors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Type 1 (bare-metal) hypervisors: These hypervisors run directly on the host&rsquo;s hardware, without the need for a host operating system. Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type 2 (hosted) hypervisors: These hypervisors run on top of a host operating system and manage virtual machines within the host environment. Examples include Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, and Microsoft Virtual PC.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In both cases, the hypervisor is the key component that enables virtualization, providing the necessary management and isolation between virtual machines running on a single physical host.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[14:05]</code> Are there alnatives of hypervisor?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, there are alternatives to hypervisors for creating isolated environments. Some of these alternatives include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Containers: Containers are a lightweight form of virtualization that enables the running of multiple isolated applications on the same host without the need for a full-fledged hypervisor. Containers share the host&rsquo;s kernel and can run directly on the host&rsquo;s operating system, leading to less overhead compared to hypervisors. Examples of container technologies include Docker, LXC, and Kubernetes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paravirtualization: Paravirtualization is an approach to virtualization where the guest operating system is modified to be aware of the virtualized environment and communicates directly with the host&rsquo;s hardware through a thin layer called the paravirtualization interface. This approach can offer better performance than full virtualization, but it requires modifying the guest operating system, which may not always be feasible. Xen is an example of a paravirtualization platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application-level virtualization: Application-level virtualization isolates individual applications rather than entire operating systems, allowing them to run in a sandboxed environment. This can provide isolation and security benefits without the overhead of full-system virtualization. Examples of application-level virtualization include Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which runs Java applications in a sandboxed environment, and Microsoft&rsquo;s .NET runtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OS-level virtualization: OS-level virtualization provides isolated environments by partitioning a single operating system into multiple isolated instances called zones, jails, or namespaces. Each instance has its own file system, network stack, and process space, but they all share the same kernel. Examples of OS-level virtualization technologies include Solaris Zones, FreeBSD Jails, and Linux namespaces.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These alternatives each have their own advantages and trade-offs, and their suitability depends on the specific use case and requirements of the system being virtualized.</p>
<hr />
<h2>VM @ Papers.OP-TEE.0406.md</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[13:56]</code> Does VM require hypervisor?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, virtual machines (VMs) typically require a hypervisor to function. A hypervisor is the essential component responsible for creating, managing, and running VMs on a physical host system. It allocates the physical resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, among the VMs and provides isolation between them. VMs are essentially software-based environments running on the hypervisor, which simulates the hardware and allows multiple VMs with different operating systems to share the same physical hardware resources.</p>
<p>There are alternative virtualization technologies, such as containerization (e.g., Docker), which do not rely on a hypervisor but instead use the host operating system&rsquo;s kernel to isolate and manage containers. However, in the context of traditional virtual machines, a hypervisor is a necessary component for their operation.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[14:07]</code> Can a VM contain VMs?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, a virtual machine (VM) can contain other VMs, a concept known as nested virtualization. In nested virtualization, a hypervisor runs inside a virtual machine created by another hypervisor. This creates a hierarchy of virtual machines, where the primary hypervisor manages the first-level virtual machines, and the nested hypervisors manage the second-level virtual machines.</p>
<p>Nested virtualization can be useful in various scenarios, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Testing and development: Nested virtualization allows developers to test and experiment with different hypervisors and configurations without needing multiple physical machines.</li>
<li>Training: Nested virtualization can be used for educational purposes, providing hands-on experience with different virtualization technologies.</li>
<li>Cloud environments: Nested virtualization can help cloud providers support customers who want to use their own hypervisors on top of the cloud provider&rsquo;s infrastructure.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, nested virtualization can also introduce additional overhead and complexity, which can negatively impact the performance of the nested VMs. Additionally, not all hypervisors support nested virtualization, and hardware virtualization support may be required for acceptable performance.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Virtualization @ Papers.OP-TEE.0406.md</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[13:59]</code> What are types of virtualization techs?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>There are various types of virtualization technologies, each targeting a specific layer of computing or specific use cases. Here are some of the major types:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hardware or Platform Virtualization: This type of virtualization involves the creation of virtual machines (VMs) that share the physical hardware resources of a host system. Examples of hypervisors that enable this type of virtualization include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and KVM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operating System Virtualization: This technology involves the creation of isolated environments, or containers, within a single host operating system. Each container shares the host OS&rsquo;s kernel but can have its own file system, libraries, and applications. Examples of containerization platforms include Docker, LXC, and Kubernetes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application Virtualization: This technique enables running applications in isolated environments on a host system without needing to install them. Application virtualization ensures that the application&rsquo;s dependencies do not interfere with the host system or other applications. Examples include Microsoft App-V and VMware ThinApp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network Virtualization: This type of virtualization abstracts the physical network infrastructure, allowing multiple virtual networks to share the same physical hardware. Network virtualization enables better utilization of resources, improved security, and easier network management. Examples include VMware NSX and Cisco ACI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Storage Virtualization: Storage virtualization abstracts the physical storage devices, allowing them to be pooled and managed centrally. This enables better resource utilization, improved performance, and easier management. Examples of storage virtualization technologies include software-defined storage (SDS) solutions, such as Ceph and VMware vSAN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Desktop Virtualization: This technology enables the delivery of a virtual desktop environment to users over a network. It separates the user&rsquo;s desktop environment from the physical hardware, allowing for centralized management, better resource utilization, and improved security. Examples of desktop virtualization solutions include VMware Horizon and Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few examples of virtualization technologies, and many more specific solutions and implementations exist in the industry.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Hypervisor @ Papers.OP-TEE.0406.md</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[14:04]</code> Is hypvervisor a virtual machine manager?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, a hypervisor is often referred to as a virtual machine manager (VMM). A hypervisor is a software or firmware that manages the creation, execution, and management of virtual machines (VMs) on a host system. It allows multiple VMs to run concurrently on the same physical hardware, while providing isolation and resource management between them.</p>
<p>Hypervisors are responsible for abstracting the physical hardware resources and allocating them to the VMs, handling the VMs&rsquo; requests for resources, and ensuring that the VMs do not interfere with each other or the host system. They play a crucial role in the virtualization process, making it possible to create and manage VMs efficiently and securely.</p>
<hr />
<h2>TCB @ TrustZone.0329.md</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[16:32]</code> What are components in TCB?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is the set of all hardware, firmware, and software components critical to the security of a system. These components are responsible for enforcing the security policy and maintaining the system&rsquo;s integrity, confidentiality, and availability.

<h2>Papers.OP-TEE.0406.md</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[08:09]</code> What does the paper &ldquo;Bao: A Lightweight Static Partitioning Hypervisor for Modern Multi-Core Embedded Systems&rdquo; talk about? Virtualization, TEE or TrustZone?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The paper &ldquo;Bao: A Lightweight Static Partitioning Hypervisor for Modern Multi-Core Embedded Systems&rdquo; focuses on virtualization in the context of modern multi-core embedded systems. It presents Bao, a minimal, standalone, and clean-slate implementation of the static partitioning architecture for Armv8 and RISC-V platforms. The primary goal of Bao is to achieve strong spatial and temporal isolation in embedded systems while keeping the virtualization overhead minimal.</p>
<p>While the paper does not directly discuss Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) or TrustZone, it addresses the need for isolation in embedded systems, which is a concern that TEEs and TrustZone also aim to address. Bao is a hypervisor for embedded systems, which is a different approach to achieving isolation compared to TEEs and TrustZone.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[08:18]</code> Is OP-TEE required in TrustedVIM described in the page &ldquo;Cloud &amp; Edge Trusted Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM) - Security and Trust in OpenStac&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The page &ldquo;Cloud &amp; Edge Trusted Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM) - Security and Trust in OpenStack&rdquo; does not specifically mention OP-TEE as a requirement for TrustedVIM. However, it does mention that TrustedVIM uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to ensure secure execution of critical services, which can be provided by ARM TrustZone, Intel SGX, or other TEE technologies.</p>
<p>OP-TEE is an open-source implementation of TEE based on ARM TrustZone technology. It could be a possible solution to provide the TEE capabilities required by TrustedVIM, but it is not explicitly stated as a requirement. TrustedVIM can leverage any TEE technology that meets its security and trust requirements.</p>

<h2>TrustZone.0329.md</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[16:31]</code> Is OP-TEE a kind of TCB?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, OP-TEE (Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment) can be considered a part of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) when used in a system. The TCB consists of all the components critical to the security of a system, including hardware, firmware, and software that enforce the security policies.</p>
<p>OP-TEE is a software component that provides a secure environment for trusted applications to execute within the TrustZone technology of ARM processors. In this context, OP-TEE is responsible for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of trusted applications and their data. Since it plays a critical role in maintaining the security of the system, OP-TEE is considered part of the TCB.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[16:31]</code> Is secure boot a TCB?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, secure boot can be considered part of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) as it is crucial to the security of a system. Secure boot is a process that ensures only authenticated and authorized software is allowed to run on a device during the boot process. It verifies the integrity and authenticity of the firmware and operating system components using cryptographic signatures.</p>
<p>Since secure boot is responsible for establishing the chain of trust from the initial boot stage to the full execution of the operating system, it plays a vital role in the overall security of the system. Thus, secure boot is part of the TCB.</p>
