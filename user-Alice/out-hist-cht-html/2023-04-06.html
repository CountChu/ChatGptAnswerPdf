<h1>Q &amp; A</h1>
<h2>OP-TEE.0327.md</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Does OP-TEE support two VMs?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>OP-TEE itself does not directly support virtualization or multiple virtual machines (VMs). However, OP-TEE can be used in conjunction with a hypervisor that supports virtualization. In such a setup, OP-TEE would run in the secure world, while multiple VMs would run in the normal world, managed by the hypervisor.</p>
<p>For instance, the ARM virtualization extensions (part of the ARMv7 and ARMv8 architectures) allow for hardware-supported virtualization. If you have a hypervisor that supports ARM virtualization extensions, such as KVM or Xen, you can run multiple VMs on the same hardware platform while leveraging OP-TEE for secure services.</p>
<p>In this scenario, OP-TEE can provide secure services to all VMs running in the normal world. Each VM can have its client applications (CAs) that communicate with Trusted Applications (TAs) running within the OP-TEE environment. The hypervisor ensures isolation between VMs and manages the communication between VMs and OP-TEE.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the hypervisor should be configured properly to ensure the secure world remains isolated from the normal world and that proper access control policies are in place to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> https://optee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/virtualization.html</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The link you provided points to the official OP-TEE documentation on virtualization. According to the documentation, OP-TEE does support virtualization in the sense that it can work with virtualized environments managed by a hypervisor. The hypervisor is responsible for managing VMs running in the normal world, while OP-TEE provides secure services in the secure world.</p>
<p>The documentation also mentions that OP-TEE has been tested with Xen on ARM, and there are ongoing efforts to test it with KVM on ARM. This indicates that OP-TEE can be used in conjunction with virtualization solutions like Xen and KVM to provide secure services to multiple VMs running on the same hardware platform.</p>
<p>However, it is crucial to ensure that the hypervisor is correctly configured to maintain the secure world's isolation from the normal world and that proper access control policies are in place to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Does OP-TEE support VMs?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, OP-TEE supports working with virtual machines (VMs) in the sense that it can operate in a virtualized environment managed by a hypervisor. The hypervisor is responsible for managing VMs running in the normal world, while OP-TEE provides secure services in the secure world.</p>
<p>In a virtualized environment, OP-TEE works in conjunction with a hypervisor, like Xen or KVM on ARM, to provide secure services to multiple VMs running on the same hardware platform. The hypervisor ensures the secure world's isolation from the normal world and enforces proper access control policies to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that OP-TEE itself does not directly manage the VMs; it works with a hypervisor that is responsible for managing the VMs in the normal world.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Can hypervisor run in secure world?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, a hypervisor can run in the secure world, but it is less common. Typically, hypervisors run in the normal world, and they manage VMs in the normal world while ensuring their isolation. However, there are secure world hypervisors, like ARM TrustZone-based hypervisors, which are designed to run in the secure world and manage secure partitions or secure VMs.</p>
<p>A secure world hypervisor manages the secure partitions, including OP-TEE, and ensures their isolation from each other and the normal world. In this configuration, OP-TEE acts as one of the secure partitions managed by the secure world hypervisor. This approach allows multiple secure services to coexist in the secure world, each running in its own isolated partition or secure VM.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning that having a hypervisor in the secure world adds complexity to the system, and its implementation must ensure that it does not introduce vulnerabilities or weaken the security guarantees provided by the secure world.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is the technology of OP-TEE supporting VMs mature?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The technology of OP-TEE supporting VMs is maturing but may not be considered fully mature yet. There have been significant efforts put into enabling OP-TEE to work with virtual machines and hypervisors. OP-TEE does provide support for virtualization, as described in its documentation, and some projects, such as XEN Project, have been working on integrating OP-TEE with their hypervisors.</p>
<p>However, the maturity of this technology can vary depending on the specific use cases, hardware platforms, and hypervisors in question. It is advisable to assess the maturity of the technology on a case-by-case basis and consult with experts or the community to ensure that the chosen solution meets the required security and performance needs.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is hypervisor?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a type of software that enables the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs) on a physical host machine. The hypervisor is responsible for abstracting the underlying hardware resources of the host and allocating them to the virtual machines, allowing multiple VMs to run simultaneously on a single host.</p>
<p>There are two main types of hypervisors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Type 1 hypervisor (Bare-metal): This type of hypervisor runs directly on the host's hardware without the need for an underlying operating system. It provides strong isolation between VMs and efficiently manages hardware resources. Examples of Type 1 hypervisors include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type 2 hypervisor (Hosted): This type of hypervisor runs on top of an existing operating system, which acts as the host. The VMs are created and managed within the host OS. Type 2 hypervisors typically have higher overhead and lower performance compared to Type 1 hypervisors, but they can be easier to set up and manage. Examples of Type 2 hypervisors include VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hypervisors enable efficient use of computing resources, making it possible to run multiple operating systems and applications on the same physical hardware, improving resource utilization, and enabling greater flexibility in managing workloads. They are widely used in data centers, cloud computing environments, and for virtualization in general.</p>

<pre><code>Paper: vTZ: Virtualizing ARM TrustZone

Abstract
ARM TrustZone, a security extension that provides a secure
world, a trusted execution environment (TEE), to
run security-sensitive code, has been widely adopted in
mobile platforms. With the increasing momentum of
ARM64 being adopted in server markets like cloud, it
is likely to see TrustZone being adopted as a key pillar
for cloud security. Unfortunately, TrustZone is not
designed to be virtualizable as there is only one TEE
provided by the hardware, which prevents it from being
securely shared by multiple virtual machines (VMs).
This paper conducts a study on variable approaches to
virtualizing TrustZone in virtualized environments and
then presents vTZ, a solution that securely provides each
guest VM with a virtualized guest TEE using existing
hardware. vTZ leverages the idea of separating functionality
from protection by maintaining a secure co-running
VM to serve as a guest TEE, while using the hardware
TrustZone to enforce strong isolation among guest TEEs
and the untrusted hypervisor. Specifically, vTZ uses a
tiny monitor running within the physical TrustZone that
securely interposes and virtualizes memory mapping and
world switching. vTZ further leverages a few pieces of
protected, self-contained code running in a Constrained
Isolated Execution Environment (CIEE) to provide secure
virtualization and isolation among multiple guest
TEEs. We have implemented vTZ on Xen 4.8 on both
ARMv7 and ARMv8 development boards. Evaluation
using two common TEE-kernels (secure kernel running
in TEE) such as seL4 1 and OP-TEE shows that vTZ provides
strong security with small performance overhead.

<pre><code>Paper: Cloud &amp; Edge Trusted Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM) - Security and Trust in OpenStack

Abstract
The Fifth Generation (5G) mobile networks promise
faster connectivity and futuristic applications and services. In
order to meet the high expectations, 5G joins forces with
virtualization technologies like Network Functions Virtualization
(NFV) and adopts cloud-native solutions. At the same time,
it relies on shifting the computation to the network edge for
offloading computing power, local caching, minimized latency
and flexibility in the deployment. However, new opportunities
unlock new security challenges. Man-in-the-middle, denial-ofservice
attacks and tampering are now becoming easier because
of the scattered devices and their varying locations. Meanwhile,
the dynamic nature of the cloud raises the need for on-time
threats prevention.
In this work, we propose a way to answer the new challenges
by bringing trust into the virtualized edge infrastructure. We
present our contributions to the development of security services
for platform authentication and integrity, hosted inside a trusted
execution environment (TEE). We also evaluate the performance
overhead of our work and suggest future improvements.

<pre><code>Title: Enabling Rack-scale Confidential Computing using Heterogeneous Trusted Execution Environment

Abstract
With its huge real-world demands, large-scale confidential
computing still cannot be supported by today’s Trusted
Execution Environment (TEE), due to the lack of scalable and
effective protection of high-throughput accelerators like GPUs,
FPGAs, and TPUs etc. Although attempts have been made
recently to extend the CPU-like enclave to GPUs, these solutions
require change to the CPU or GPU chips, may introduce
new security risks due to the side-channel leaks in CPU-GPU
communication and are still under the resource constraint of
today’s CPU TEE.
To address these problems, we present the first Heterogeneous
TEE design that can truly support large-scale compute or data
intensive (CDI) computing, without any chip-level change. Our
approach, called HETEE, is a device for centralized management
of all computing units (e.g., GPUs and other accelerators) of a
server rack. It is uniquely designed to work with today’s data centres
and clouds, leveraging modern resource pooling technologies
to dynamically compartmentalize computing tasks, and enforce
strong isolation and reduce TCB through hardware support.
More specifically, HETEE utilizes the PCIe ExpressFabric to
allocate its accelerators to the server node on the same rack
for a non-sensitive CDI task, and move them back into a secure
enclave in response to the demand for confidential computing.
Our design runs a thin TCB stack for security management on a
security controller (SC), while leaving a large set of software (e.g.,
AI runtime, GPU driver, etc.) to the integrated microservers that
operate enclaves. An enclaves is physically isolated from others
through hardware and verified by the SC at its inception. Its
microserver and computing units are restored to a secure state
upon termination.
We implemented HETEE on a real hardware system, and
evaluated it with popular neural network inference and training
tasks. Our evaluations show that HETEE can easily support
the CDI tasks on the real-world scale and incurred a maximal
throughput overhead of 2.17% for inference and 0.95% for
training on ResNet152.

<pre><code>Title: SoK: Understanding the Prevailing Security Vulnerabilities in TrustZone-assisted TEE Systems

Abstract
Abstract—Hundreds of millions of mobile devices worldwide
rely on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) built with Arm
TrustZone for the protection of security-critical applications (e.g.,
DRM) and operating system (OS) components (e.g., Android
keystore). TEEs are often assumed to be highly secure; however,
over the past years, TEEs have been successfully attacked
multiple times, with highly damaging impact across various
platforms. Unfortunately, these attacks have been possible by
the presence of security flaws in TEE systems. In this paper, we
aim to understand which types of vulnerabilities and limitations
affect existing TrustZone-assisted TEE systems, what are the
main challenges to build them correctly, and what contributions
can be borrowed from the research community to overcome
them. To this end, we present a security analysis of popular
TrustZone-assisted TEE systems (targeting Cortex-A processors)
developed by Qualcomm, Trustonic, Huawei, Nvidia, and Linaro.
By studying publicly documented exploits and vulnerabilities as
well as by reverse engineering the TEE firmware, we identified
several critical vulnerabilities across existing systems which
makes it legitimate to raise reasonable concerns about the security
of commercial TEE implementations.

<pre><code>Title: RusTEE: Developing Memory-Safe ARMTrustZone Applications

Abstract
In the past decade, Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) provided
by ARM TrustZone is becoming one of the primary techniques for
enhancing the security of mobile devices. The isolation enforced
by TrustZone can protect the trusted applications running in the
TEE against malicious software in the untrusted rich execution environment
(REE). However, TrustZone cannot completely prevent
vulnerabilities in trusted applications residing in the TEE, which
can then be used to attack other trusted applications or even the
trusted OS. Previously, a number of memory corruption vulnerabilities
have been reported on different TAs, which are written in
memory-unsafe languages like C.
Recently, various memory-safe programming languages have
emerged to mitigate the prevalent memory corruption bugs. In
this paper, we propose RusTEE, a trusted application mechanism
that leverages Rust, a newly emerged memory-safe language, to
enhance the security of TAs. Though the high-level idea is quite
straight-forwarding, we resolve several challenges on adopting
Rust in mobile TEEs. Specifically, since Rust currently does not
support any TrustZone-assisted TEE systems, we extend the existing
Rust compiler for providing such support. Also, we apply
comprehensive security mechanisms to resolve two security issues
of trusted applications, namely, securely invoking high-privileged
system services and securely communicating with untrusted REE.
We implement a prototype of RusTEE as the trusted applications’
SDK, which supports both emulator and real hardware devices.
The experiment shows that RusTEE can compile applications with
close-to-C performance on the evaluated platforms.

<p>Paper Summary:</p>
<p>The paper titled "RusTEE: Developing Memory-Safe ARM TrustZone Applications" addresses the issue of vulnerabilities in trusted applications running in ARM TrustZone's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). While TrustZone provides isolation to protect trusted applications from malicious software in the untrusted rich execution environment (REE), it cannot prevent vulnerabilities within trusted applications themselves. Many trusted applications are written in memory-unsafe languages like C, leading to reported memory corruption vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The authors propose RusTEE, a trusted application mechanism that uses Rust, a memory-safe programming language, to enhance the security of trusted applications. They address several challenges in adopting Rust for mobile TEEs, as Rust does not currently support TrustZone-assisted TEE systems. The paper presents the following contributions:</p>

<pre><code>Paper: Bao: A Lightweight Static Partitioning Hypervisor for Modern Multi-Core Embedded Systems

Abstract
Given the increasingly complex and mixed-criticality nature of modern embedded systems, virtualization
emerges as a natural solution to achieve strong spatial and temporal isolation. Widely used
hypervisors such as KVM and Xen were not designed having embedded constraints and requirements
in mind. The static partitioning architecture pioneered by Jailhouse seems to address embedded
concerns. However, Jailhouse still depends on Linux to boot and manage its VMs. In this paper,
we present the Bao hypervisor, a minimal, standalone and clean-slate implementation of the static
partitioning architecture for Armv8 and RISC-V platforms. Preliminary results regarding size, boot,
performance, and interrupt latency, show this approach incurs only minimal virtualization overhead.
Bao will soon be publicly available, in hopes of engaging both industry and academia on improving
Bao’s safety, security, and real-time guarantees.

<pre><code>Paper: Research on ARM TrustZone

ARM TrustZone [1] is a hardware-based security feature that can provide software with a high-privilege and
isolated execution environment. Such isolation is ensured by hardware, which is usually considered as more
trustworthy than software. Thus the execution environment is also known as trusted execution environment
(TEE). TrustZone technology was proposed in 2002, but did not get widely used until 2009, when Apple
released iPhone 5s. In iPhone 5s, Apple leveraged TrustZone to protect its Touch ID, which ensures that
even if the iOS is fully compromised, the user's fingerprint data can still be safe. In 2017, Google made TEE
a mandatory requirement on any Android devices with a fingerprint scanner. Nowadays, almost all mobile
phones and tablets have TEE deployed. Meanwhile, ARM integrates TrustZone in ARM64 and ARMv8-M
to support a broader range of platforms including servers and IoT devices.

<pre><code>Paper: TEEv: Virtualizing Trusted Execution Environmentson Mobile Platforms

Abstract
Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) are widely deployed,
especially on smartphones. A recent trend in TEE development
is the transition from vendor-controlled, single-purpose
TEEs to open TEEs that host Trusted Applications (TAs) from
multiple sources with independent tasks. This transition is
expected to create a TA ecosystem needed for providing
stronger and customized security to apps and OS running in
the Rich Execution Environment (REE). However, the transition
also poses two security challenges: enlarged attack
surface resulted from the increased complexity of TAs and
TEEs; the lack of trust (or isolation) among TAs and the TEE.
In this paper, we first present a comprehensive analysis
on the recent CVEs related to TEE and the need of multiple
TEE scheme. We then propose TEEv, a TEE virtualization
architecture that supports multiple isolated, restricted TEE
instances (i.e., vTEEs) running concurrently. Relying on a
tiny hypervisor (we call it TEE-visor), TEEv allows TEE
instances from different vendors to run in isolation on the
same smartphone and to host their own TAs. Therefore,
a compromised vTEE cannot affect its peers or REE; TAs
no longer have to run in untrusted/unsuitable TEEs. We
have implemented TEEv on a development board and a real
smartphone, which runs multiple commercial TEE instances

<pre><code>The below context are of the section "Other Platforms: IoT, Drone, Cloud" of the paper "Research on ARM TrustZone"

Besides mobile phones, there are many

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>In the "Other Platforms: IoT, Drone, Cloud" section of the paper "Research on ARM TrustZone", the authors discuss the application of ARM TrustZone technology to various platforms, including IoT devices, drones, and cloud computing.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ditio [17] aims to enhance the security of IoT devices by recording sensor activity logs using TrustZone and virtualization support. It records all accesses to sensor registers without modifying the Rich Execution Environment (REE) OS, generating a complete log of sensor activities. An auditor later inspects these logs for compliance with a given policy. Ditio also provides a tool to simplify the log analysis process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PROTC [18] leverages TrustZone on drone platforms to protect peripherals. It deploys a monitor in the secure world to enforce secure access control policies for specific drone peripherals, ensuring that only authorized applications can access them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ARM servers, which are gaining popularity in cloud computing, support virtualization. However, TrustZone can only provide a single secure world, meaning that multiple VMs on one server must share the only secure world. vTZ [19] addresses this problem by virtualizing TrustZone to offer each VM an isolated secure world. With vTZ, software in a VM can use the SMC instruction to switch between REE and a virtual TEE, retaining all TrustZone features after virtualization. This implementation requires an REE hypervisor but doesn't need to trust it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> In the context, Why does the implementation not need to trust REE hypervisor?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The implementation of vTZ does not need to trust the REE (Rich Execution Environment) hypervisor because it provides isolation between the virtualized Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and the REE. The main goal of vTZ is to allow each VM (Virtual Machine) to have its own isolated secure world, separate from the REE hypervisor.</p>
<p>TrustZone technology ensures that the secure world (TEE) and the normal world (REE) are isolated from each other at the hardware level, which prevents the REE from accessing the secure world's resources and data. When virtualizing TrustZone with vTZ, this hardware-enforced isolation is maintained, allowing the virtual TEEs to function securely without trusting the REE hypervisor.</p>
<p>In other words, the security of the virtual TEEs does not rely on the trustworthiness of the REE hypervisor, as the hardware-level isolation provided by ARM TrustZone protects the TEEs from potential attacks or vulnerabilities in the REE hypervisor.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How does the hardware-level isolation provided by ARM TrustZone protect the virtual TEEs from attackes in the REE hypervisor?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>ARM TrustZone technology provides hardware-level isolation between the secure world (Trusted Execution Environment, TEE) and the normal world (Rich Execution Environment, REE). This isolation is achieved by partitioning the system resources (such as processor, memory, and peripherals) into secure and non-secure domains. TrustZone ensures that the REE cannot access resources or data in the secure domain.</p>
<p>When TrustZone is virtualized using a solution like vTZ, each virtual machine (VM) is provided with its own isolated secure world, which is separated from the REE hypervisor. This means that the virtual TEEs can continue to function securely, even if the REE hypervisor is compromised.</p>
<p>The hardware-level isolation provided by TrustZone protects the virtual TEEs from attacks originating in the REE hypervisor in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Memory isolation: TrustZone enforces strict memory access control policies, preventing the REE from accessing secure memory regions. This ensures that sensitive data stored in the virtual TEEs is protected from unauthorized access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure peripherals: TrustZone can protect peripherals (such as cryptographic accelerators and secure storage) by only allowing access from the secure world. This prevents the REE hypervisor from tampering with or eavesdropping on secure operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure interrupts and exception handling: TrustZone enables the secure world to handle interrupts and exceptions securely, without being affected by the REE hypervisor. This prevents the REE from interfering with the secure world's execution flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure state transitions: TrustZone controls the transition between the secure and non-secure worlds. This ensures that the REE hypervisor cannot arbitrarily switch between worlds, impersonate the secure world, or execute unauthorized code in the secure world.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By maintaining the hardware-level isolation, even in a virtualized environment, TrustZone effectively protects the virtual TEEs from potential attacks or vulnerabilities in the REE hypervisor.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> But vTZ actually run in normal world. How does the hardware-level isolation provided by ARM TrustZone protect the virtual TEEs from attackes in the REE hypervisor?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>My apologies for the confusion. You are correct that vTZ runs in the normal world (REE). In the vTZ design, the REE hypervisor is responsible for managing the virtualization of the TrustZone, while the secure world remains responsible for handling secure operations.</p>
<p>The hardware-level isolation provided by ARM TrustZone still plays a crucial role in protecting the virtual TEEs from attacks in the REE hypervisor, even when vTZ is running in the normal world. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Secure Monitor Call (SMC): TrustZone uses SMC to switch between the REE and TEE. In the vTZ design, each VM can use the SMC instruction to switch between its own REE and virtual TEE. The SMC handler, which resides in the secure world, manages the transitions between worlds, ensuring that the hypervisor cannot arbitrarily switch between worlds or access the virtual TEEs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isolation of secure state: TrustZone maintains separate processor states for the secure and non-secure worlds. The secure state includes the secure world's CPU registers, which are inaccessible from the normal world. This isolation prevents the REE hypervisor from tampering with the secure state of the virtual TEEs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure memory: TrustZone enforces memory access control policies that prevent the REE hypervisor from accessing secure memory regions. In the vTZ design, the secure memory is allocated to the virtual TEEs, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected from unauthorized access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mediated access to secure resources: vTZ leverages the secure world to mediate access to secure resources, such as cryptographic keys or secure storage. This ensures that the REE hypervisor cannot access these resources directly, protecting the virtual TEEs from attacks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While vTZ does run in the normal world, it relies on the hardware-level isolation provided by ARM TrustZone to ensure that the virtual TEEs remain protected from attacks or vulnerabilities in the REE hypervisor. The key aspect is the separation of duties, with the REE hypervisor managing the virtualization of TrustZone, and the secure world handling the secure operations and maintaining the isolation of the virtual TEEs.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>In this section, the authors discuss how ARM TrustZone technology is applied to different types of platforms, such as IoT devices, drones, and cloud computing. They provide examples of various projects and research that utilize TrustZone to improve the security of these platforms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ditio: This project aims to enhance the security of IoT devices by recording sensor activity logs using TrustZone and virtualization support. Ditio captures access to sensor registers without modifying the Rich Execution Environment (REE) operating system. This generates a complete log of sensor activities that can be audited and checked for compliance with specific policies. Ditio also offers a tool for easier log analysis.</p>

The implementation requires an REE hypervisor but does not need to trust it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These examples showcase the versatility of TrustZone technology and its potential for improving security on various platforms beyond mobile phones.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> In the context, vTZ run in normal world. Why does not vTZ run in normal world need to trust REE hypervisor?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>vTZ is designed to virtualize ARM TrustZone to offer each virtual machine (VM) an isolated secure world. Although vTZ runs in the normal world, it does not need to trust the REE hypervisor because of the hardware-level isolation provided by ARM TrustZone.</p>
<p>TrustZone ensures a strong isolation between the secure world (trusted execution environment) and the normal world (rich execution environment). When vTZ is implemented, it leverages the security features provided by TrustZone to maintain a separation between the virtual TEEs and the REE hypervisor.</p>
<p>As a result, even though vTZ operates in the normal world and interacts with the REE hypervisor, the secure world components (virtual TEEs) remain protected from potential attacks or vulnerabilities in the REE hypervisor. This isolation allows vTZ to run securely without having to trust the REE hypervisor.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Please compare TEEv and vTZ and also summarize them in a table.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>TEEv and vTZ are two different approaches to virtualize Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) on mobile platforms. Here is a comparison and summary of both in the form of a table:</p>
<p>| Aspect            | TEEv                                                                   | vTZ                                                                     |

| Architecture      | Relying on a tiny hypervisor (TEE-visor)                              | Requires an REE hypervisor but does not need to trust it                |
| Implementation    | Runs multiple commercial TEE instances from different vendors         | Uses SMC instruction to switch between REE and a virtual TEE            |
| Security          | Isolates vTEEs and defends against known attacks on TEE                | Preserves all TrustZone features after virtualization                   |
| Performance       | Mild performance overhead                                              | Not explicitly mentioned                                                |</p>
<p>TEEv is a TEE virtualization architecture that supports multiple isolated, restricted TEE instances (vTEEs) running concurrently. It relies on a tiny hypervisor called the TEE-visor, allowing TEE instances from different vendors to run in isolation on the same smartphone and host their own Trusted Applications (TAs). TEEv can isolate vTEEs and defend against all known attacks on TEEs with only mild performance overhead.</p>
<p>vTZ aims to virtualize TrustZone to provide each VM an isolated secure world. This approach requires an REE hypervisor but does not need to trust it, as the hardware-level isolation provided by TrustZone is leveraged to maintain separation between the virtual TEEs and the REE hypervisor. With vTZ, software in a VM can use the SMC instruction to switch between the REE and a virtual TEE, just as it does in a non-virtualized environment, preserving all the features of TrustZone after virtualization.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is static partitioning?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Static partitioning is a method of resource allocation in which system resources, such as memory, CPU time, and I/O devices, are divided into fixed, non-overlapping partitions. Each partition is assigned to a specific application, task, or virtual machine. The allocation of resources is determined at design time or during system initialization, and it remains fixed during the runtime of the system.</p>
<p>Static partitioning is often used in real-time and safety-critical systems, where strong spatial and temporal isolation between tasks is required to ensure predictable system behavior and to prevent interference between tasks. This isolation helps in maintaining the performance, safety, and security of the system.</p>
<p>In the context of hypervisors, static partitioning refers to creating fixed, isolated partitions for virtual machines (VMs) or operating system instances. Each partition is allocated a fixed set of resources, such as CPU cores, memory, and I/O devices. This approach contrasts with dynamic partitioning, where resource allocation can be adjusted during runtime based on the changing needs of the system. Static partitioning in hypervisors can help achieve better isolation, predictability, and reduced overhead compared to dynamic partitioning.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is TCB?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>TCB stands for Trusted Computing Base. It refers to the set of all hardware, firmware, and software components that are critical to the security of a computing system. The TCB is responsible for enforcing security policies and maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the system and its data.</p>
<p>Ideally, the TCB should be kept as small and simple as possible to minimize potential vulnerabilities and make it easier to analyze and verify its security properties. Components within the TCB are considered trusted because any failure, bug, or vulnerability in these components can compromise the overall security of the system.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is OP-TEE a TCB?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, OP-TEE (Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment) can be considered a part of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) in a system where it is used. OP-TEE is an open-source implementation of a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) for ARM TrustZone technology. It provides a secure environment for running trusted applications isolated from the normal world.</p>
<p>As a TEE, OP-TEE enforces security policies and protects sensitive data and operations, making it an essential component of the system's overall security. By providing a trusted execution environment, OP-TEE contributes to the security and integrity of the system and thus can be considered part of the TCB.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is TA a TCB?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>A Trusted Application (TA) can be considered part of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) in a specific context where the TA is used to enforce security policies, protect sensitive data, or perform critical operations within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) like OP-TEE.</p>
<p>While the TA itself might not necessarily always be part of the TCB, when it plays a critical role in the security of a system and operates within a trusted environment, it can be considered part of the TCB. Remember, the TCB consists of all hardware, firmware, and software components that are critical to the overall security of a system, and if a TA is essential for maintaining the security of a particular system, it falls under the TCB umbrella.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What are types of TCB?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>There aren't specific "types" of Trusted Computing Base (TCB) in a categorical sense, as the TCB concept is more about the set of hardware, firmware, and software components that play a critical role in ensuring the security of a system. However, we can describe TCBs based on their scope, size, or the security domains they belong to.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Scope:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local TCB: Covers components within a single device or system.</li>
<li>Distributed TCB: Covers components across multiple devices or systems in a network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Size:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimal TCB: Includes only the essential components necessary to maintain the system's security, keeping the attack surface as small as possible.</li>
<li>Extended TCB: May include additional components, increasing functionality at the cost of a larger attack surface.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware TCB: Comprises hardware components like processors, memory controllers, and cryptographic accelerators.</li>
<li>Firmware TCB: Includes firmware components like BIOS, UEFI, or bootloader.</li>
<li>Software TCB: Covers software components like operating systems, hypervisors, or trusted applications running within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that these classifications are not rigid or mutually exclusive, and the actual TCB of a system may overlap or include elements from multiple categories based on the system's architecture and security requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Please compare TrustZone and Hypervisor and also summarize in a table.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>TrustZone and hypervisors serve different purposes in providing security and isolation in computer systems, but they can also be complementary. Here's a comparison between the two:</p>
<p>TrustZone:
1. Purpose: Provides hardware-based security and isolation between the secure and non-secure worlds.
2. Scope: Limited to ARM-based systems.
3. Implementation: Built into the ARM processor, enabled by the SoC vendor.
4. Isolation: Creates two separate execution environments (secure world and normal world).
5. Use Cases: Secure boot, key storage, cryptographic operations, and DRM.</p>
<p>Hypervisor:
1. Purpose: Enables the virtualization of multiple operating systems or environments on a single physical host.
2. Scope: Applicable to various processor architectures (x86, ARM, etc.).
3. Implementation: Software-based, can be a Type-1 (bare-metal) or Type-2 (hosted) hypervisor.
4. Isolation: Creates multiple virtual machines (VMs) or containers, each running a separate OS or application.
5. Use Cases: Server consolidation, sandboxing, running multiple OSes on a single device, and cloud computing.</p>
<p>Summary in a table:</p>
<p>| Feature      | TrustZone                | Hypervisor           |
|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Purpose      | Hardware-based security  | Virtualization       |
| Scope        | ARM-based systems        | Multiple platforms   |
| Implementation| Built into ARM processor | Software-based       |
| Isolation    | Secure and normal worlds | Virtual machines/containers |
| Use Cases    | Secure boot, key storage, crypto operations, DRM | Server consolidation, sandboxing, multiple OSes, cloud computing |</p>
<p>Keep in mind that TrustZone and hypervisors can be used together in some cases to enhance the overall security of a system. For example, a TrustZone-enabled secure world can host a secure hypervisor to further isolate and protect sensitive applications.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is hypervisor a software or a hardware?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>A hypervisor is a software component that enables virtualization, allowing multiple operating systems or environments to run on a single physical host. Hypervisors can be classified into two types:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Type-1 hypervisors (bare-metal hypervisors): These hypervisors run directly on the hardware, providing better performance and more efficient resource management. Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type-2 hypervisors (hosted hypervisors): These hypervisors run on top of a host operating system, sharing the system's resources with the guest operating systems. Examples include VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, hypervisors are software components that enable virtualization and are not hardware themselves. However, some modern processors have hardware-assisted virtualization features that can improve the performance and security of hypervisors.</p>
