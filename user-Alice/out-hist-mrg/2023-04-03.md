# Q & A
## Boot ```(230327.OP-TEE.yaml)```
**Question:** `[09:21]` Does OP-TEE OS exist in a single core or multiple cores at run-time? `(OP-TEE.0327.md)`

**Answer:**

At runtime, the OP-TEE OS exists in a single core. It is designed to run on one core at a time in the secure world. However, OP-TEE supports concurrent execution of Trusted Applications (TAs) on different CPU cores. Although the OS itself runs on a single core, it can manage and schedule TAs running on separate cores, ensuring proper execution and isolation.

## OP-TEE.0327.md
**Question:** `[09:20]` Does OP-TEE exist in a single core or multiple cores at run-time? `(OP-TEE.0327.md)`

**Answer:**

OP-TEE can run on both single-core and multi-core systems. The OP-TEE OS itself is designed to run on one core at a time in the secure world. However, OP-TEE supports concurrent execution of Trusted Applications (TAs) on different CPU cores. This means that multiple TAs can run in parallel on separate cores, while the normal world can still run its applications on other cores. The scheduling and synchronization of TAs are handled by the OP-TEE OS to ensure proper execution and isolation.
