By being a dedicated hardware component, it offers enhanced security features, ensuring that sensitive data and operations are isolated from potential vulnerabilities in the main CPU or other system components. This helps prevent unauthorized access or tampering, even if other parts of the system are compromised.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Does SPU have secret keys? <code>(2023/4/13)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the Secure Processing Unit (SPU) in Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon SoCs can store and manage secret keys. The SPU is designed to handle sensitive data, including cryptographic keys, ensuring that they are protected from unauthorized access or tampering.</p>
<p>The SPU provides hardware-based security features, such as secure key storage, secure boot, and cryptographic operations, all within an isolated environment separate from the main CPU. By securely managing secret keys and performing encryption and decryption operations within the SPU, it helps maintain the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data, even if other parts of the system are compromised.</p>
<p>In summary, the SPU in Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon SoCs is designed to store and manage secret keys securely, providing an additional layer of hardware-based security for sensitive data and operations.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Does SPU rely on ARMv8? <code>(2023/4/10)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Qualcomm&rsquo;s Secure Processing Unit (SPU) is a hardware component introduced in 2017 within their Snapdragon SoCs. While the SPU functions as a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and leverages ARM TrustZone technology, it is not specifically dependent on ARMv8 architecture.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that many of Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon SoCs, including those that feature the SPU, do utilize the ARMv8 architecture. The ARMv8 architecture provides improved performance, energy efficiency, and security features, including support for TrustZone.</p>
