Intro to Intel SGX
(Binding keys to programs using
Intel SGX remote attestation)

Secure Implementation of Cryptographic Software
Metochi, Lesbos, Greece – August 2017

Intel SGX
Intel SGX is a set of processor instructions which
allow one:
● To set up an enclave (code & memory) such that
the code runs in a way that it and its memory are
protected from interference from the OS and other
software
● To securely report the state of the enclave, locally
and remotely
Present on all (major) Intel processors from Skylake
(2015) onwards

3
Not the first
hardware security anchor
ARM TrustZone
● ARM processors have
two execution modes,
with hardwareenforced
access
control between them:
– “Normal world”
Runs the rich OS
(e.g., Android) and
apps
– “Secure world”
Runs securitycritical
code.
Trusted platform module (TPM)
● Version 1 (2004), 1.2 (2008),
2.0 (2014-)
● Separate chip soldered to motherboard
● API that allows you to create keys
whose secret part never leaves the
TPM
– A key can be locked to “authdata”
(like a password to use the key)
– And/or can be locked to PCR
values, which “measure” the boot
sequence
Best known use: Microsoft Bitlocker

4
Intel SGX: attacks addressed
An enclave within an app is protected from
interference from other software, including the OS
and VMM. Note that enclaves can only run in ring
3 (user space).

5
Intel SGX: attacks not addressed
● Side-channel attacks
Cache and page access patterns
– Extraction of RSA secret keys, under assumptions,
by co-located [enclave] processes
– Programmer is expected to mitigate this attack
● Hardware attacks
– Chip decapsulation
– Trojan hardware: vulnerabilities possibly introduced
in the supply chain

6
Intel SGX
Well suited for:
● Cloud computing (“reverse
DRM”), in which your device
sends data to a cloud
server, and you want to
impose restrictions on how it
is processed
Not suited for:
● Applications that involve I/O on
the platform
– Password managers
– Banking apps
Partly suited for:
● DRM, where a server delivers
content to your device, along
with restrictions on how you
use it
Discussion 1: What about sidechannel
attacks?

Intel SGX concepts
Protected memory
● Enclave Page Cache (EPC), access control, MEE
Enclave
● “SGX enclave control structure” (SECS)
– Core data about the enclave, held in a dedicated
EPC page.
● Life cycle of an enclave
– Creation / loading / initialisation (aka launching) /
teardown

11
Intel SGX concepts
Enclave measurement
● An enclave measurement (noted MRENCLAVE) is a hash of its
code and initial data
Enclave identity
● MRENCLAVE: Its measurement is the strictest way to identify an
enclave.
● MRSIGNER: An “enclave certificate” is a more flexible way to
identify an enclave. The certificate is signed by the “independent
software vendor” (ISV), and includes ISVPRODID and ISVSVN.
– Allows data migration from old security versions to new ones.

12
Intel SGX concepts
Processor instructions
● ECREATE, EADD, EEXTEND, EINIT, … : managing the
enclave life cycle
● EGETKEY, EREPORT, … : managing data within an enclave.
Intel-provided enclaves
● Launch enclave
● Provisioning enclave
● Quoting enclave

13
Intel SGX secret values
Some secret values are built into the platform.
Known to the processor and to Intel:
● SGX Master derivation key
– Derived from provisioning secret
Known to theprocessor (but not to Intel)
● Seal secret (also known as SEAL_FUSES)
● OWNER_EPOCH

14
Setting up an enclave
● System software uses ECREATE to set up the initial memory
page allocated to the enclave, which contains the SGX Enclave
Control Structure (SECS)
● It uses EADD to allocate further pages containing enclave code
and initial data
● It uses EEXTEND to update the enclave’s ‘measurement’
● After loading the initial code and data pages into the enclave, the
system uses a ‘Launch Enclave’ (LE) to obtain an EINIT token
– The token is provided to the EINIT instruction to initialise the
enclave
– LE is a privileged enclave provided (e.g.) by Intel, signed by
and Intel private key

15
Initialising an enclave (more detail)
Untrusted system software sets up SECS and the enclave
certificate SIGSTRUCT
A launch enclave
● checks the enclave certificate SIGSTRUCT against SECS
● checks the “launch policy”
● produces EINITTOKEN
● Produces the EINITTOKEN MAC using a launch key obtained using
EGETKEY

What an enclave can do
● Computations
● Access its own [encrypted] memory
● Access app memory
● Communicate with user, but insecurely
● Communicate with another party, which can be secure if the enclave
shares a key with the other party
● Attest its identity (a hash of its binary and initial data) to another party
● “Seal” data, i.e. encrypt data with a key that only it can access, for
persistent storage
– Can use Platform Service Enclave (PSE) for trusted time and
monotonic counter
● Teardown

Migrating data between enclaves
● Discussion 4:
– Can a sealed blob made in an enclave be migrated to a
different enclave on the same platform and decrypted by that
other enclave?
– Can a sealed blob made in an enclave be migrated to an
identical enclave (same MRENCLAVE/MRSIGNER) on a
different platform and decrypted by that other enclave?

19
Migrating data between enclaves
● Discussion 4:
– Can a sealed blob made in an enclave be migrated to a
different enclave on the same platform and decrypted by that
other enclave?
In general, no! (It would be insecure if that was possible).
But, yes if the new enclave is a security update of the old
one, and the seal key had KEYPOLICY=MRSIGNER.
– Can a sealed blob made in an enclave be migrated to an
identical enclave (same MRENCLAVE/MRSIGNER) on a
different platform and decrypted by that other enclave?
No. Sealed blobs are encrypted with keys built from platformspecific
secrets. If you want this kind of migration, you need
to use remote attestation.

20
Migrating data between enclaves
● Same platform, same enclave (just a different instance):
– Sealed blob can migrate.
● Same platform, different enclave:
– If it’s a newer security version of the same ISVPRODID, and
the KEYPOLICY is set to MRSIGNER, then the sealed blob
can be migrated.
– More generally, the EREPORT mechanism can be used to
set up a secure channel between two arbitrary enclaves on
the same platform
● Different platform, same or different enclave:
– Need remote attestation.

21
Remote attestation
● How can a remote party know that it is talking to a given
enclave?
– An enclave is identified by MRENCLAVE [strict] or by
MRSIGNER/ISVPRODID [more flexible]
● How can a remote party know that a given key can be used
exclusively by a given enclave?

23
Privacy concern: not acceptable because RP can identify

24
Intel would like to be able to revoke platform attestation keys if:
● Revocation based on private key:
the private part is seen in the wild (e.g. published on the
Internet), or
● Revocation based on signature:
the key is perceived as signing erratically
Possible solutions
● Certificate revocation-list checking, or
● Short-lived certificates, that must be renewed periodically
(e.g., every month)
Objection 2: revocation concern

25
Issuer: gpk, isk
Join: Pi obtains ski by interacting with issuer
Sign: σ = sign (m); or (if ski is revoked) σ = 
Verify: Verify(gpk, m, PrivRL, SigRL, σ) = valid or invalid
Revoke:
● RevokePriv (gpk, ski)
– checks ski, and
– adds ski to PrivRL
● RevokeSig (gpk, PrivRL, m, σ)
– verifies σ, and
– adds σ to SigRL
EPID Signatures and Verification

26
Provisioning the attestation key
● A ‘provisioning enclave’ uses EGETKEY to obtain a
symmetric ‘provisioning key’ which Intel can also compute
● It runs the EPID join protocol with Intel (protected by the
provisioning key), obtaining its attestation signing key
● It uses EGETKEY to obtain a ‘provisioning seal key’ and
stores the attestation key encrypted by the provisioning
seal key
Remote attestation

27
Producing a REPORT
● The attesting enclave uses EREPORT to produce a report
structure, MAC’d with a report key
● The report is passed to a quoting enclave
Quoting the report
● The quoting enclave uses EGETKEY to obtain a report
key to check the report MAC
● It uses EGETKEY to obtain a provisioning seal key to
decrypt the attestation key
● It uses the attestation key to sign the report (along with a
received challenge)

SGX: a powerful architecture for managing secret data
+ Enables processing of data that cannot be read by anyone, except
for code running in the enclave
+ Minimal TCB: nothing trusted except for x86 processor
+ Not suitable for applications involving user I/O, but well suited for
cloud-based applications
- Hardware and side-channel attacks
- Requires interaction with Intel at three distinct points:
– Launch approval (by platform)
– Join protocol to obtain attestation key (by platform)
– Verify protocol to verify attestation (by relying party)
- Among other objections, this is privacy-invasive
Conclusions

**ChatGPT:**

Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions) is a set of processor instructions that enable secure execution of code and data within protected memory regions called enclaves. These enclaves are designed to protect code and data from unauthorized access, even by the operating system and other software. Intel SGX is particularly suited for cloud computing scenarios where data privacy and protection are essential.

Some key features of Intel SGX include:

1. Enclave creation: Setting up a protected memory region that holds the code and data securely.
2. Enclave lifecycle management: Managing the creation, loading, initialization, and teardown of enclaves.
3. Identity attestation: Attesting the identity (MRENCLAVE or MRSIGNER/ISVPRODID) of an enclave to a remote party.
4. Data sealing: Encrypting data using a key that only the enclave can access, enabling secure persistent storage.
5. Remote attestation: Allowing a remote party to verify that they are communicating with a specific enclave and securely exchange data.

However, Intel SGX does not protect against side-channel attacks and hardware attacks, such as chip decapsulation or vulnerabilities introduced in the supply chain.

Intel SGX can be used in various scenarios, such as ensuring confidentiality from cloud providers or implementing DRM (Digital Rights Management) systems. It is not well-suited for applications that involve I/O on the platform, like password managers or banking apps.

Why is Intel SGX not suited for password managers?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Intel SGX is not well-suited for password managers primarily because of its limitations in handling input/output (I/O) operations. Password managers usually require user interaction for entering master passwords, copying generated passwords, and auto-filling login forms. These actions involve I/O operations that are outside the scope of the enclave's protected environment.

In addition, Intel SGX is vulnerable to certain side-channel attacks, which can potentially leak sensitive information, such as passwords or encryption keys, by analyzing the access patterns of the CPU cache or other hardware resources. While Intel SGX provides strong isolation and protection against software-based attacks, it cannot completely secure applications that require sensitive I/O operations, such as password managers or banking apps.

However, this does not mean that Intel SGX is entirely useless for such applications. It can still be used to enhance specific aspects of these applications, like securing the storage and processing of sensitive data within the enclave. But, due to the I/O limitations and side-channel vulnerabilities, it is not a comprehensive solution for securing password managers or similar applications.

What does "size of TCB" mean?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

"Size of TCB" refers to the size of the Trusted Computing Base. The Trusted Computing Base is a term used in computer security to describe the set of all hardware, firmware, and software components that are critical to a system's security. The TCB is responsible for enforcing the security policies of a system, and its integrity is crucial to maintain the overall security of the system.

The size of the TCB is an important consideration because it generally correlates with the potential attack surface and the complexity of the system. A smaller TCB typically indicates a more focused and manageable set of components, which can be more easily analyzed, verified, and secured. On the other hand, a larger TCB can introduce more potential vulnerabilities and make it more difficult to ensure the security of the system.

In the context of hardware security mechanisms, like Intel SGX, a smaller TCB may provide stronger protection against attacks, as there are fewer components that could be exploited. Reducing the size of the TCB is one of the primary goals in designing secure systems, as it helps to minimize the attack surface and the potential for security vulnerabilities.

What is "accountable decryption"?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Accountable decryption is a concept in cryptography that aims to ensure that the decryption of encrypted data can be traced back to a specific party or entity. This concept is often employed in systems where multiple parties have access to the decryption keys, and it's important to know who decrypted the data for various reasons, such as security, auditing, or legal compliance.

In an accountable decryption scheme, the decryption process generates a unique proof or decryption tag that can be used to identify the party responsible for the decryption. This proof or tag is often linked to the decryption key or the party's identity in a way that cannot be forged or tampered with. This allows for the attribution of decryption actions to specific parties, enabling better control and monitoring of access to sensitive information.

Accountable decryption can be implemented through various cryptographic techniques, including threshold cryptography, digital signatures, and zero-knowledge proofs. The choice of technique depends on the specific requirements and the overall system design.

What is "Launch Enclave"?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

A Launch Enclave is a secure environment in the context of Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), a set of security-related instruction codes that are built into some Intel processors. The Launch Enclave is responsible for verifying and controlling the launch of other secure enclaves within the SGX environment.

In Intel SGX, enclaves are isolated, protected memory regions that run sensitive code and store sensitive data. They are designed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of this information from external threats, even in the presence of compromised operating systems or hardware.

The Launch Enclave is a special enclave provided by Intel that plays a crucial role in the SGX ecosystem. When an application wants to create and run a new enclave, it must first request the Launch Enclave to create a launch token. The Launch Enclave verifies the new enclave's identity and attributes, and if everything is in order, it creates the launch token. This token is then used by the application to launch the new enclave.

By controlling the launch of other enclaves, the Launch Enclave helps maintain the security and integrity of the SGX environment. It ensures that only trusted and authorized enclaves can be created and executed, thus preventing rogue enclaves from compromising the security of the system.

Is Launch Enclave a software?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, the Launch Enclave is a software component provided by Intel as part of the Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) framework. It is designed to run within the secure environment of an Intel SGX-enabled processor.

The Launch Enclave is a specific enclave with predefined functionality that manages the creation and launch of other secure enclaves within the SGX environment. By acting as a gatekeeper, the Launch Enclave helps ensure that only authorized and trusted enclaves are executed, maintaining the overall security of the system.

Does  Launch Enclave  run in OS?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The Launch Enclave runs within the secure environment provided by Intel SGX, which is a set of security-related instruction codes built into Intel processors. While it is not part of the operating system (OS) itself, it does interact with the OS through a set of APIs and drivers.

The OS plays a role in managing the resources and interactions between the untrusted, non-secure part of the system and the secure enclave environment. In this sense, the Launch Enclave does run on a system with an OS, but it operates within the protected enclave environment provided by the Intel SGX, isolated from the untrusted portion of the OS.

Does the binary of Launch Enclave exits in BIOS or ME?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The binary of the Launch Enclave does not reside in the BIOS or the Intel Management Engine (ME). The Launch Enclave is a part of the Intel SGX software stack, which is installed on the operating system. The Intel SGX software stack includes the Intel SGX SDK and Platform Software (PSW).

The Launch Enclave is loaded as part of the Intel SGX runtime system when an application wants to create a new enclave. The Launch Enclave binary is signed by Intel, and its primary purpose is to verify and manage the launch of other enclaves, ensuring that they have been signed with an authorized launch key.

While the Launch Enclave is not directly part of the BIOS or ME, both the BIOS and ME play a role in enabling Intel SGX on the system. The BIOS must support and properly configure the hardware for Intel SGX, and the Intel ME is responsible for managing security features and providing cryptographic services to the system, including those related to Intel SGX.

**ChatGPT:**

No, the Launch Enclave is provided by Intel as part of the Intel SGX software stack. Intel is responsible for signing the Launch Enclave binary and distributing it as a part of the Intel SGX SDK and Platform Software (PSW). This is an important aspect of the SGX security model, as it allows Intel to maintain control over the trustworthiness of the Launch Enclave and ensure that only authorized enclaves can be launched on SGX-enabled systems.

What is endorsement key?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

An endorsement key (EK) is a unique, private cryptographic key that is embedded within a security device or module, such as a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) or a hardware security module (HSM). This key is generated during the manufacturing process and is paired with a corresponding public key. The private portion of the endorsement key is never exposed outside of the secure environment and is used to prove the authenticity and integrity of the device.

The public portion of the endorsement key is typically used along with a certificate issued by the manufacturer, which serves as a proof of the device's authenticity. This certificate is called the endorsement certificate and is used to establish trust in the device's identity during secure communications or attestation processes.

In summary, the endorsement key is a fundamental component of hardware-based security solutions, as it helps to establish trust and verify the authenticity of a device or module in secure communications and attestation scenarios.

How does the Solution 1 "Privacy CA for provisioning ak" work? Please list the steps.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

"Privacy CA for provisioning ak" refers to using a Privacy Certification Authority (Privacy CA) to provision an Attestation Key (ak) for a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) while maintaining the privacy of the device. The process allows a TPM to interact with third parties without disclosing its unique identity. Here are the steps involved in this solution:

1. TPM generates an Attestation Key (ak) pair: The TPM generates a public-private key pair intended for use in attestation. The private part of the key remains within the TPM, while the public part is shared externally.

2. TPM creates an Attestation Key Certificate Request: The TPM generates a certificate signing request (CSR) for the public portion of the Attestation Key. This request typically includes information about the TPM, such as its public Endorsement Key (EK) and the desired ak.

3. Privacy CA verifies TPM identity: The Privacy CA receives the CSR and verifies the authenticity of the TPM using the provided public EK and the corresponding endorsement certificate issued by the TPM manufacturer. The Privacy CA may also check other information, such as the platform's conformance to certain security standards.

4. Privacy CA issues an Attestation Key Certificate: Once the Privacy CA is satisfied with the TPM's authenticity, it signs the CSR and generates an Attestation Key Certificate. This certificate is then sent back to the TPM.

5. TPM receives and stores the Attestation Key Certificate: The TPM securely stores the Attestation Key Certificate, linking the ak to a trusted Privacy CA. This certificate can be used in future attestation processes to establish trust with third parties.

In summary, using a Privacy CA for provisioning an Attestation Key (ak) involves generating an ak pair within the TPM, creating a CSR for the public ak, verifying the TPM's identity by the Privacy CA, issuing an Attestation Key Certificate, and securely storing this certificate in the TPM. This process allows the TPM to prove its authenticity and integrity while preserving its privacy.

How does the Solution 1 "Privacy CA for provisioning ak" work with Intel SGX? Please list the steps.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions) is a set of hardware-based security features that enable secure execution of applications within isolated enclaves, protecting data and code from unauthorized access. While Intel SGX doesn't rely on TPM for its operation, it also follows a remote attestation process that involves provisioning an attestation key. Here are the steps involved in this process:

1. Application Developer creates an SGX Enclave: The developer writes an application and creates an enclave to protect the sensitive parts of the application. The enclave contains both code and data that must be protected from unauthorized access.

2. Enclave is signed: The enclave must be cryptographically signed by the application developer, ensuring its integrity and authenticity. The enclave's identity and metadata are included in the enclave signature.

3. Enclave is loaded and initialized: When the application runs, the enclave is loaded into the protected memory area, called the Enclave Page Cache (EPC). The processor initializes the enclave and verifies the enclave's signature.

4. Provisioning Enclave Attestation Key (ak) pair: Similar to the TPM process, Intel SGX generates a public-private key pair for attestation within the enclave. The private part of the key remains within the enclave, while the public part is shared externally.

5. Creating a certificate signing request (CSR): The enclave generates a CSR for the public portion of the Attestation Key (ak). This request typically includes information about the enclave, such as its identity and metadata.

6. Remote Attestation Service (IAS): Intel provides an Intel Attestation Service (IAS) that serves as a Privacy CA for Intel SGX enclaves. The CSR is sent to the IAS, which verifies the authenticity and integrity of the enclave and its measurements.

7. IAS issues an Attestation Key Certificate: Once the IAS is satisfied with the enclave's authenticity and integrity, it signs the CSR and generates an Attestation Key Certificate. This certificate is then sent back to the enclave.

8. Enclave receives and stores the Attestation Key Certificate: The enclave securely stores the Attestation Key Certificate, linking the ak to the trusted IAS. This certificate can be used in future remote attestation processes to establish trust with third parties.

In summary, the remote attestation process for Intel SGX enclaves involves creating an enclave, signing it, loading and initializing it, provisioning an attestation key pair, creating a CSR, verifying the enclave's authenticity and integrity through the IAS, issuing an Attestation Key Certificate, and securely storing the certificate within the enclave. This process enables secure communication between the enclave and external parties, while maintaining privacy and ensuring integrity.

What is "Privacy CA"?

A Privacy Certification Authority (Privacy CA) is a trusted third-party entity that issues digital certificates in a privacy-preserving manner. Privacy CAs play a crucial role in remote attestation processes for secure hardware platforms, such as Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions) and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs).

The main purpose of a Privacy CA is to verify the authenticity and integrity of a secure hardware platform or an enclave (in the case of Intel SGX) without revealing sensitive information about the platform or enclave to other parties. The Privacy CA is responsible for validating the identity and measurements of the secure platform, and then issuing a digital certificate as proof of the platform's trustworthiness.

In this process, the Privacy CA acts as an intermediary between the secure platform and the external party seeking to establish a trusted communication channel. The Privacy CA helps to maintain the confidentiality of the platform's sensitive information while still providing the necessary level of assurance to the external party.

For example, in the context of Intel SGX, the Privacy CA is the Intel Attestation Service (IAS). The IAS issues digital certificates for Intel SGX enclaves after verifying their authenticity and integrity based on measurements provided by the enclave during the remote attestation process.
