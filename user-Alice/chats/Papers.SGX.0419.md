ABSTRACT 
Intel is developing the Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® 
SGX) technology, an extension to Intel® Architecture for 
generating protected software containers. The container is referred 
to as an enclave. Inside the enclave, software’s code, data, and 
stack are protected by hardware enforced access control policies that prevent attacks against the enclave’s content. In an era w here 
software and services are deployed over the Internet, it is critical 
to be able to securely provision enclaves remotely, over the wire 
or air, to know with confidence that the secrets are protected and 
to be able to save secrets in non-volatile memory for future use. 
This paper describes the technology components that allow 
provisioning of secrets to an enclave. These components include a method to generate a hardware based attestation of the software running inside an enclave and a means for enclave software to seal 
secrets and export them outside of the enclave (for example store 
them in non-volatile memory) such that only the same enclave software would be able un-seal them back to their original form.

1 INTRODUCTION 
In an era where software and services are deployed over the 
Internet, Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX), and 
extension to Intel® Architecture enables service providers to 
provision applications over the wire or air with sensitive content, 
and to know with confidence that their secrets are properly protected. In order to do so, the service providers must be able to know with certainty what software is running on the remote 
platform and in which environment it is executing. 
1.1 Software Lifecycle  
Intel® SGX-enabled software does not ship with sensitive data. 
After the software is installed, it contacts the service provider to 
have data remotely provisioned to the enclave. The software then 
encrypts the data and stores it for future use. Figure 1 illustrates 
the steps software takes to complete this processes. 
 
1. Enclave Launch – The untrusted application launches 
the enclave environment to protect the service provider's 
software. While the enclave is built, a secure log is recorded reflecting the contents of the enclave and how 
it was loaded. This secure log is the encla ve’s 
"Measurement."

2. Attestation –The enclave contacts the service provider to 
have its sensitive data provisioned to the enclave. The 
platform produces a secure asse rtion that identifies the 
hardware environment and the enclave.  
3. Provisioning – The service provider assesses the 
trustworthiness of the enclave. It uses the attestation to 
establish secure communication and provision sensitive 
data to the enclave. Using the secure channel, the service provider sends the data to the enclave. 
4. Sealing/Unsealing – The enclave uses a persistent 
hardware-based encryption key to securely encrypt and 
store its sensitive data in a way that ensures the data can 
be retrieved only when the trusted environment is restored. 
5. Software Upgrade – Enclave software updates might be 
required by the service provider. To streamline the migration of data from an older software version to the 
newer version, the software can request seal keys from 
older versions to unseal the data and request the new 
version ’s seal so that  the sealed data won’t be available 
to previous versions of the software.  
 
Finally, when platform owners plan to transfer ownership of the 
platform, the secrets available during their ownership period 
should be made inaccessible. Intel® SGX includes a user owned special persistent value that, when changed, changes all keys available to software. 
1.2 Security Model  
A service provider that wishes to provision secrets to a remote 
platform must know, in advance, that the protection policies of the remote platform meet the protection requirements of the secrets to be deployed. According to Intel® SGX ’s security model  [1], the 
trusted computing base (TCB) in charge of protecting the secrets 
includes the processor ’s firmware and hardware and only the 
software inside the enclave. 
An enclave writer can use Intel® SGX ’s dedicated sealing 
and attestation components that uphold the security model 2 
 assertions below to prove to the service provider that the secrets 
will be protected according to the intended security level: 
 Intel® SGX provides an enclave instance with the means 
to request a secure assertion from the platform of the 
enclave’s identity.  
 Intel® SGX also allows the enclave to bind 
enclave ephemeral data to the assertion. 
 Intel® SGX provides the means for an enclave instance 
to verify assertions originating from other enclave instances on the same platform. 
 Intel® SGX provides the means for remote entity to 
verify assertions from an enclave instance. 
 Intel® SGX allows an enclave instance to obtain keys 
that are bound to the platform and the enclave. 
 Intel® SGX prevents software  access to keys 
of other Enclave Identities 
1.3 Intel® SGX Instructions  
The Intel® SGX Architecture [1] provides the hardware 
instructions, EREPORT and EGETKEY,  to support attestation and 
sealing. Secret owners that accept SGX ’s security mode l can rely 
on these instructions to report back the TCB in charge of the 
secrets. 
To create the enclave environment, untrusted software uses 
Intel® SGX  instructions. These instructions also compute the 
cryptographic measurement of the launched environment. These 
processes are further described in section 2 of this paper. 
To enable attestation and sealing, the hardware provides two 
additional instructions EREPORT  and EGETKEY . The EREPORT  
instruction provides an evidence st ructure that is cryptographically 
bound to the hardware for consumption by attestation verifiers. 
EGETKEY  provides enclave software with access to the “Report” 
and “Seal” keys used in the attestati on and sealing process. The 
use of these instructions to provide an attestation of the enclave is 
discussed in section 3, and to protect the secrets delivered to the enclave in section 4. 
In section 5 we briefly review related work in the field of 
establishing remote trust in platforms.

Abstract

Intel is developing Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX), an extension to Intel® Architecture for generating protected software containers called enclaves. These enclaves protect software's code, data, and stack by hardware enforced access control policies. This paper describes the technology components for provisioning secrets to an enclave, including a hardware-based attestation method and a means for enclave software to seal secrets and export them outside of the enclave. This ensures that only the same enclave software can un-seal them back to their original form.

1. Introduction

In an era where software and services are deployed over the Internet, Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) enables service providers to securely provision applications with sensitive content. Service providers must be able to know with certainty what software is running on a remote platform and the environment it is executing in. Intel® SGX's security model includes the processor's firmware, hardware, and only the software inside the enclave.

1.1 Software Lifecycle

The software lifecycle consists of the following steps:

1. Enclave Launch - The untrusted application launches the enclave environment.
2. Attestation - The enclave contacts the service provider and produces a secure assertion about its identity.
3. Provisioning - The service provider assesses the enclave's trustworthiness and establishes secure communication to provision sensitive data.
4. Sealing/Unsealing - The enclave securely encrypts and stores its sensitive data.
5. Software Upgrade - Enclave software updates may be required, and the data migration is streamlined.

1.2 Security Model

Intel® SGX's dedicated sealing and attestation components ensure that secrets will be protected according to the intended security level. The components provide an enclave instance with means to request a secure assertion, bind ephemeral data to the assertion, verify assertions originating from other enclave instances, allow remote entities to verify assertions, obtain keys bound to the platform and enclave, and prevent software access to keys of other Enclave Identities.

1.3 Intel® SGX Instructions

Intel® SGX Architecture provides hardware instructions, EREPORT and EGETKEY, to support attestation and sealing. To create the enclave environment, untrusted software uses Intel® SGX instructions, which also compute the cryptographic measurement of the launched environment. EREPORT instruction provides an evidence structure bound to the hardware, while EGETKEY provides enclave software with access to the "Report" and "Seal" keys used in the attestation and sealing process.

The chapter "2 MEASUREMENT" of the Paper.


2 MEASUREMENT 
The Intel® SGX architecture is responsible for establishing 
identities for attestation and sealing. For each enclave it provides two measurement registers, MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER; 
MRENCLAVE provides an identity of the enclave code and data 
as it’s constructed and MRSIGNER provides an identity of an 
authority over the enclave. These values are recorded while the enclave is built, and are finalized before enclave execution 
commences. Only the TCB has access to write to these registers in 
order to ensure an accurate reflection of the identities is available when attesting and sealing. 
2.1 MRENCLA VE - Enclave Identity  
The “E nclave Identity ” is the value of MRENCLAVE, which is a 
SHA-256[2] digest of an internal log that records all the activity 
done while the enclave is built [1]. The log consists of the 
following information:   
 
x The contents of the pages (code, data, stack, heap). 
x The relative position of the pages in the enclave. 
x Any security flags associated with the pages. 
 
Once enclave initialization is complete, through the EINIT  
instruction, no more updates are made to MRENCLAVE. The final 
value of MRENCLAVE is a SHA-256 digest that identifies, cryptographically, the code, data, and stack placed inside the enclave, the order and position in which the enclave’s pages were 
placed, and the security properties of each page. Any change to 
any of these variables would lead to a different value in 
MRENCLAVE.  
2.2 MRSIGNER - Sealing Identity  
The enclave has a second identity used for data protection called 
the “Sealing Identity.” The Sealing Identity includes a “Sealing 
Authority,” a product ID and a version number. The Sealing 
Authority is an entity that signs the enclave prior to distribution, 
typically the enclave builder. The enclave builder presents the 
hardware with an RSA signed enclave certificate (SIGSTRUCT) that contains the expected value of the Enclave Identity, 
MRENCLAVE, and the public key of the Sealing Authority. The 
hardware checks the signature on the certificate, using the public key contained within, and then it compares the value of the 
measured MRENCLAVE against the signed version. If these 
checks pass, a hash of the public key of the Sealing Authority is 
stored in the MRSIGNER register. It is important to note that if 
multiple enclaves are signed by the same Sealing Authority, they 
will all have the same MRSIGNER value. As shown in Section 4, 
the value of Sealing Identity can be used for sealing data in a way 
that enclaves from the same Sealing Authority (e.g., different versions of the same enclave) can share and migrate their sealed 
data.

2. MEASUREMENT

The Intel® SGX architecture establishes identities for attestation and sealing, providing two measurement registers for each enclave: MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER. MRENCLAVE is an identity of the enclave code and data, while MRSIGNER is an identity of an authority over the enclave. These values are recorded during the enclave's construction and finalized before its execution. Only the TCB can write to these registers to ensure accurate reflection of the identities.

2.1 MRENCLAVE - Enclave Identity

The "Enclave Identity" is the value of MRENCLAVE, a SHA-256 digest of an internal log that records all activity done while the enclave is built. This log includes the contents of the pages (code, data, stack, heap), the relative position of the pages in the enclave, and any security flags associated with the pages. After the EINIT instruction, no more updates are made to MRENCLAVE. The final value of MRENCLAVE identifies, cryptographically, the code, data, and stack inside the enclave, the order and position of the enclave's pages, and the security properties of each page. Any change to these variables would result in a different MRENCLAVE value.

2.2 MRSIGNER - Sealing Identity

The enclave has a second identity for data protection called the "Sealing Identity," which includes a "Sealing Authority," a product ID, and a version number. The Sealing Authority, typically the enclave builder, signs the enclave before distribution. The enclave builder presents the hardware with an RSA signed enclave certificate (SIGSTRUCT) containing the expected value of the Enclave Identity (MRENCLAVE) and the Sealing Authority's public key. The hardware checks the signature on the certificate and compares the measured MRENCLAVE value against the signed version. If these checks pass, a hash of the Sealing Authority's public key is stored in the MRSIGNER register. Enclaves signed by the same Sealing Authority will have the same MRSIGNER value. As shown in Section 4, the Sealing Identity value can be used for sealing data so that enclaves from the same Sealing Authority can share and migrate their sealed data.

The chapter "3 ATTESTATION " of the Paper.

3 ATTESTATION 
Attestation is the process of demonstrating that a piece of software 
has been properly instantiated on the platform. In Intel® SGX it is the mechanism by which another party can gain confidence that the correct software is securely running within an enclave on an 
enabled platform. In order to do this the Intel® SGX architecture 
produces an attestation assertion (shown in Figure 2) that conveys 
the following information: 
 
x The identities of the software environment being attested 
x Details of any non-measureable state (e.g. the mode the 
software environment may be running in) 
x Data which the software environment wishes to 
associated with itself 
x A cryptographic binding to the platform TCB making 
the assertion

Meta-Data
Figure 2: Attestation Assertion Creation 
The Intel® SGX architecture provides one mechanism for 
creating an authenticated assertion between two enclaves running 
on the same platform (local attestation), and another mechanism 
for extending local attestation to provide assertions to 3rd parties 
outside the platform (remote attestation).  
Finally, in order to gain maximum trustworthiness in the 
system, the attestation key should only be bound to a specific 3 
 platform TCB. Should the platform TCB change, say through a 
microcode update, the platform attestation key should be replaced 
in order to properly represent the trustworthiness of the TCB. 
3.1 Intra-Platform Enclave Attestation  
Application developers may wish to write enclaves which can co-
operate with one another to perform some higher-level function. In order to do this they need a mechanism for the enclaves to authenticate one another. For this purpose Intel® SGX architecture 
provides the EREPORT  instruction.   
When invoked by an enclave, EREPORT  creates a signed 
structure, known as a REPORT. The REPORT structure contains the two identities of the enclave, the attributes  associated with the 
enclave (attributes identify modes and other properties established 
during ECREATE ), the trustworthiness of the hardware TCB, and 
additional information the enclave developer wishes to pass on to 
the target enclave, and a message authentication code (MAC) tag. 
The target enclave is the enclave which will verify the MAC over 
the REPORT allowing it to determine that the enclave that created 
the REPORT has run on the same platform. 
The MAC is produced with a key called the “Report Key”. 
As shown in Table 1, Report Key is known only to the target 
enclave and to the EREPORT  instruction. The validating (target) 
enclave can retrieve its own Report Key using the EGETKEY  
instruction. EGETKEY  provides enclaves with keys, among them 
the Report Key, usable for symmetric encryption and 
authentication. The target enclave uses the Report Key to re-compute the MAC over the REPORT data structure, and verify that the REPORT was produced by the attesting (reporting) 
enclave. The Intel® SGX architecture uses AES128-CMAC [3] as 
the MAC algorithm. 
 
Table 1: Access to Report Key and Seal Key 
Key Instruction Key association 
Seal Key EGETKEY Current enclave 
Report Key EREPORT Target enclave 
EGETKEY Current enclave 
 
Each REPORT structure also includes a 256-bit field for 
User Data. This field binds data that is inside the enclave to the 
identity of the enclave (as expressed by the REPORT). This field 
can be used to extend the REPORT with auxiliary data by populating it with a hash digest of of the auxiliary data, which is then provided alongside the REPORT. The use of the User Data 
field enables an enclave to build a higher level protocol to form a 
secure channel between itself and another entity.  
For example, by exchanging REPORTs that authenticate 
public Diffie-Hellman keys, that were randomly generated inside 
the enclave using mutually agreed parameters, the enclaves can 
generate an authenticated shared secret and use it to protect further 
communications between themselves. The Intel® Architecture supports the generation of true random values through the RDRAND instruction [4] available for use by enclave software. 
 The figure below shows an example flow of how two 
enclaves on the same platform would authenticate each other and 
verify that the other party is running inside an enclave on the same 
platform and therefore meets Intel® SGX ’s security model User PlatformApplication A Application BN

Figure 3: Intra-Platform Attestation Example 
1. After communication paths between enclave A and B have 
been established, enclave A obtains enclave B’s  
MRENCLAVE value. Note that the communication path in 
this step doesn’t have to be secure.  
2. Enclave A invokes the EREPORT  instruction together with 
enclave B’s MRENCLAVE to create a signed REPORT 
destined for enclave B. Enclav e A transmits its REPORT to 
enclave B via the untrusted communication path. 
3. After receiving the REPORT from enclave A: 
x Enclave B calls EGETKEY  to retrieve its Report Key, re-
computes the MAC over the REPORT structure, and 
compares the result with the MAC accompanying the 
REPORT. A match in the MAC value affirms that A is indeed an enclave that is running on the same platform 
as enclave B and as such that A is running in an 
environment that abides to Intel® SGX ’s security 
model.  
x Once the firmware and hardware components of the 
TCB have been verified, Enclave B can then examine 
Enclave A’s REPORT to verify the software 
components of the TCB: 
o MRENCLAVE reflects the contents of the 
software image running inside the enclave.  
o MRSIGNER reflects the sealer’s identity  
x Enclave B can then reciprocate by creating a REPORT 
for enclave A, by using the MRENCLAVE value from 
the REPORT it just received.  
x Enclave B transmits its REPORT to enclave A. Enclave 
A can then verify the report in a similar manner to 
enclave B confirming that enclave B exists on the same 
platform as enclave A. 
3.2 Inter-Platform Enclave Attestation  
The authentication mechanism used for Intra-platform enclave 
attestation uses a symmetric key system, where only the enclave verifying the REPORT structure and the EREPORT  instruction 
that creates the REPORT have access to the authentication key. 
Creating an attestation that can be verified outside the platform 
requires using asymmetric cryptography. The Intel® SGX enables a special enclave, called the Quoting Enclave, which is devoted to 
remote attestation. The Quoting Enclave verifies REPORTs from 
other enclaves on the platform using the Intra-platform enclave 
attestation method described above, and then replaces the MAC 
over these REPORTs with a signature created with a device specific (private) asymmetric key. The output of this process is called a QUOTE. 
3.2.1 Intel® Enhanced Privacy ID (EPID)  
Attestation using standard asymmetric signing schemes has drawn 
privacy concerns when a small number of keys are used across the 
life of the platform. To overcome this problem Intel has introduced 
an extension to the Direct Anonymous Attestation scheme used by 
the TPM [5] &[6] called Intel® Enhanced Privacy ID (EPID)[7] that is used by the Quoting Enc lave to sign enclave attestations. 4 
 EPID is a group signature scheme that allows a platform to 
sign objects without uniquely id entifying the platform or linking 
different signatures. Instead , each signer belongs to a “group”, and 
verifiers use the group ’s public key to verify signatures. EPID 
supports two modes of signatures. In the fully anonymous mode of EPID a verifier cannot associate a given signature with a particular 
member of the group. In Pseudonymous mode an EPID verifier 
has the ability to determine whether it has verified the platform 
previously.  
3.2.2 The Quoting Enclave  
The Quoting Enclave creates the EPID key used for signing 
platform attestations which is then  certified by an EPID backend 
infrastructure. The EPID key represents not only the platform but the trustworthiness of the underlying hardware. 
Only the Quoting Enclave has access to the EPID key when 
the enclave system is operational, and the EPID key is bound to the version of the processor’s firmware. Therefore, a QUOTE can 
be seen to be issued by the processor itself.  
3.2.3 Example Remote Attestation Process  
Figure 4 shows an example of how an application with a secure 
processing element on the user platform could provide an attestation to a challenging service provider in order to receive 
some value added service from the provider. Note that many 
usages will use this process infrequently (e.g. at enrolment time) 
to provision the enclave with a communication key that will then be used directly in subsequent connections.

Figure 4: Remote Attestation Example 
1. Initially, the application needs service from outside the 
platform, and establishes communication with the service providing system. The service provider issues a challenge to 
the application to demonstrate that it is indeed running the 
necessary components inside one or more enclaves. The 
challenge itself contains a nonce for liveness purposes. 
2. The application is provided with the Quoting Enclave ’s 
Enclave Identity and passes it along with the provider’s 
challenge to the application’s enclave. 
3. The enclave generates a manifest that includes a response to 
the challenge and an ephemerally generated public key to be used by the challenger for communicating secrets back to the 
enclave. It then generates a hash digest of the manifest and 
includes it as User Data for the EREPORT instruction that 
will generate a REPORT that binds the manifest to the enclave, as described in section 3.2. The enclave then sends 
the REPORT to the application. 
4. The application forwards the REPORT to the Quoting 
Enclave for signing.  
5. The Quoting Enclave retrieves its Report Key using the 
EGETKEY  instruction and verifies the REPORT. The 
Quoting enclave creates the QUOTE structure and signs it 
with its EPID key. The Quoting Enclave returns the QUOTE 
structure to the application. 
6. The application sends the QUOTE structure and any associated manifest of supporting data to the service 
challenger. 
7. The challenger uses an EPID public key certificate and 
revocation information or an attestation verification service 
to validate the signature over the Quote. It then verifies the integrity of the manifest using USERDATA and checks the 
manifest for the response to the challenge it sent in step 1.

3 ATTESTATION
Attestation is a process that demonstrates that software has been properly instantiated on a platform. In Intel® SGX, it allows another party to gain confidence that the correct software is securely running within an enclave on an enabled platform. The Intel® SGX architecture produces an attestation assertion that conveys information such as the identities of the software environment being attested, details of any non-measurable state, data associated with the software environment, and a cryptographic binding to the platform TCB making the assertion.

The architecture provides one mechanism for creating an authenticated assertion between two enclaves running on the same platform (local attestation) and another mechanism for extending local attestation to provide assertions to 3rd parties outside the platform (remote attestation).

To gain maximum trustworthiness in the system, the attestation key should only be bound to a specific platform TCB. If the platform TCB changes, the platform attestation key should be replaced.

3.1 Intra-Platform Enclave Attestation
Intel® SGX architecture provides the EREPORT instruction for application developers to create enclaves that can co-operate with one another to perform higher-level functions. EREPORT creates a signed structure called a REPORT, containing enclave identities, attributes, hardware TCB trustworthiness, additional information, and a message authentication code (MAC) tag. The MAC is produced with a key called the "Report Key."

3.2 Inter-Platform Enclave Attestation
The authentication mechanism used for Intra-platform enclave attestation uses a symmetric key system. To create an attestation that can be verified outside the platform, asymmetric cryptography is required. Intel® SGX enables a special enclave, called the Quoting Enclave, devoted to remote attestation.

3.2.1 Intel® Enhanced Privacy ID (EPID)
Intel has introduced an extension to the Direct Anonymous Attestation scheme called Intel® Enhanced Privacy ID (EPID) to overcome privacy concerns. EPID is a group signature scheme that allows a platform to sign objects without uniquely identifying the platform or linking different signatures.

3.2.2 The Quoting Enclave
The Quoting Enclave creates the EPID key used for signing platform attestations, which is then certified by an EPID backend infrastructure. The EPID key represents not only the platform but the trustworthiness of the underlying hardware.

3.2.3 Example Remote Attestation Process
An application with a secure processing element on the user platform could provide an attestation to a challenging service provider to receive some value-added service from the provider. The process involves the user platform, application enclave, ephemeral quoting enclave, and a challenger. The remote attestation example in the paper describes the steps in detail.

The chapter "4 SEALING" of the Paper.

4 SEALING 
When an enclave is instantiated, the hardware provides protections 
(confidentiality and integrity) to its data, when it is maintained within the boundary of the enclave. However, when the enclave process exits, the enclave will be destroyed and any data that is 
secured within the enclave will be lost. If the data is meant to be 
re-used later, the enclave must make special arrangements to store the data outside the enclave.  
Table 1 above shows that EGETKEY  provides access to 
persistent Sealing Keys that enclave software can use to encrypt 
and integrity-protect data. Intel® SGX has no restrictions on the 
encryption scheme used by the enclave. Replay protection for the 
data is also possible when combined with other service offered by 
the platform, such as monotonic counters. 
4.1 Intel® SGX supported Sealing Policies  
When invoking EGETKEY , the enclave selects criteria, or a policy, 
for which enclaves may access this sealing key. These policies are useful for controlling the accessibility of sensitive data to future 
versions of the enclave.  
Intel® SGX supports two policies for Seal Keys: 
x Sealing to the Enclave Identity 
x Sealing to the Sealing Identity 
 
Sealing to the Enclave’s Identity produces a key that is 
available to any instance of this exact enclave. This does not allow 
future software to access the secrets of this enclave. Sealing to the 
enclave’s Sealing Identity produces a key that is available to some 
other enclaves signed by the same Sealing Authority. This can be 
used to allow newer enclaves to access data stored by previous versions. 
Only a subsequent instantiation of an enclave, executing 
EGETKEY  with the same policy specification, will be able to 
retrieve the Sealing Key and decrypt data that was sealed using 
that key by a previous instantiation. 
4.1.1  Sealing to the Enclave Identity  
When sealing to the enclave’s Enclave Identity, EGETKEY  bases 
the key on the value of the enclave’s MRENCLAVE. Any change that impacts the enclave’s measurement will yield a different key. 
This results in a different key for each enclave, providing full 
isolation between enclaves. A byproduct of using this policy is that 
different versions of the same enclave will also have different seal keys, preventing offline data migration.  
This policy is useful for usages where the old data should not 
be used after a vulnerability is found. For example, if the data is an 
authentication credential, the serv ice provider may revoke those 
credentials and provision new ones. Access to the old credential 
might be harmful.  
4.1.2 Sealing to the Sealing Identity  
When sealing to the enclave’s Sealing Identity, EGETKEY  bases 
the key on the value of the enclave’s MRSIGNER, and the 
enclave’s version . MRSIGNER reflects the key/identity of the 
Sealing Authority that signed the enclave’s certificate.   
The advantage of sealing to the Sealing Authority over 
sealing to the Enclave Identity is that it allows offline migration of sealed data between enclave versions. The Sealing Authority may 5 
 sign multiple enclaves and enable them to retrieve the same seal 
key. These enclaves can transpar ently access data that was sealed 
by the other.  
When sealing to a Sealing Authority, the older software 
should not be allowed to access data created by the newer software. This is true when the reason for releasing new software is to fix 
security issues. To facilitate this, the Sealing Authority has the 
option to prescribe a Security Version Number (SVN) as part of 
the Sealing Identity. EGETKEY  allows the enclave to specify 
which SVN to use when producing the Seal Key. It will only allow the enclave to specify SVNs for its Sealing Identity or previous 
ones. When the enclave seals data, it has a choice to set the 
minimum SVN value of the enclave permitted to access that 
Sealing Key. This protects future secrets from access by old 
vulnerable software, but still enables a seamless upgrade transition 
where all previous secrets are available after the upgrade.  
The SVN is not the same as a product version number. A 
product may have several versions, with different functionalities, but with the same SVN. It is the responsibility of the enclave writer 
to communicate to their customers (if necessary), which product 
versions have the same security equivalence. 
4.2 Removing Secrets from a Platform  
The architecture proposes a mechanism, known as OwnerEpoch, 
which enables the platform owner to change all the keys in the 
system by changing a single value. As OwnerEpoch is 
automatically included when requesting keys through the EGETKEY  instruction, data objects which were sealed with a 
particular OwnerEpoch value can only be unsealed if the 
OwnerEpoch is set to the same value.  
The primary purpose of this mechanism is to allow a 
platform owner to deny access to all sealed secrets on the platform, in a simple and recoverable step, before transferring the platform 
to someone else (permanently, or temporarily). Prior to 
transferring the platform, the platform owner can change the OwnerEpoch to a different value by using the hooks provided by the OEM. In case of a temporary transfer (such as for platform 
maintenance), the platform owner can restore OwnerEpoch to its 
original value once the platform is returned and can restore access 
to the sealed secrets.

Chapter 4: SEALING

4.1 Intel® SGX supported Sealing Policies

Intel® SGX provides two sealing policies for Seal Keys: Sealing to the Enclave Identity and Sealing to the Sealing Identity. These policies are essential for controlling access to sensitive data by future enclave versions. Sealing to the Enclave Identity ensures that only the exact enclave instance can access the key, whereas Sealing to the Sealing Identity allows access to other enclaves signed by the same Sealing Authority, which enables data migration between enclave versions.

4.1.1 Sealing to the Enclave Identity

When sealing to the enclave's Enclave Identity, EGETKEY bases the key on the enclave's MRENCLAVE value. This policy ensures that each enclave has a unique key and provides full isolation between enclaves. However, different versions of the same enclave will also have distinct seal keys, preventing offline data migration. This policy is useful when the old data should not be used after a vulnerability is found.

4.1.2 Sealing to the Sealing Identity

Sealing to the enclave's Sealing Identity bases the key on the enclave's MRSIGNER and version values. This method allows offline migration of sealed data between enclave versions. The Sealing Authority can sign multiple enclaves, enabling them to access the same seal key. When sealing to a Sealing Authority, the older software should not access data created by the newer software. A Security Version Number (SVN) can be used to facilitate this restriction, ensuring seamless upgrade transitions while protecting future secrets from access by old, vulnerable software.

4.2 Removing Secrets from a Platform

The architecture introduces the OwnerEpoch mechanism, which allows the platform owner to change all system keys by altering a single value. The OwnerEpoch value is automatically included when requesting keys through the EGETKEY instruction, and data objects sealed with a specific OwnerEpoch value can only be unsealed if the same value is set. This mechanism enables the platform owner to deny access to all sealed secrets on the platform before transferring it to someone else (either permanently or temporarily). The platform owner can change the OwnerEpoch value using the hooks provided by the OEM and, in the case of temporary transfers, restore the original value to regain access to sealed secrets once the platform is returned.

5 RELATED WORK 
Previous work to define hardware additions to a micro-processor 
chip for remote attestation [8] was designed for a single authority 
in hold of multiple platforms and was not easily scalable to support 
an unbound number of trusted authorities. In contrast, the Intel® 
SGX architecture allows for a plurality of distrusting enclaves, with complete separation between the enclaves and each one 
capable of securely communicating with one or more trusted 
authorities. 
Commercially, the Trusted Platform Module 1.2 [5] has seen 
widespread introduction onto PC platforms in both discrete and 
integrated form. It supports a variety of usage models that include 
attestation of and sealing to the pre-boot and OS environments. 
Attesting and sealing to programs at the application level requires 
secret owners to evaluate the whole platform stack. Previous 
attempts to address this scalability issue have included [9]. The 
Intel® SGX architecture significantly reduces the software TCB by including only the enclave software in it and provides for the 
direct measurement of application software. This significantly 
reduces the attestation evaluation  work any secret owner has to 
perform.  
The TPM relies on the platform providing a Root of Trust of 
Measurement. To gain maximum trust when issuing TPM 
Attestation Certificates a binding to a platform credential 
identifying the Root of Trust for Measurement is required. By providing the Root of Trust for Measurement along with the Root 
of Trust for Reporting, the Intel® SGX architecture allows us to 
use a single key to endorse and attest at the same time, significantly 
reducing the eco-system overhead in evaluating the 
trustworthiness of platforms.  

6 CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, a novel hardware assisted mechanism in the form of 
a new ISA extension to Intel® Architecture is proposed to allow 
secure attestation and sealing to application software executing in 
a secure environment (referred to as an enclave).  
The ISA extension provides the means for the enclave 
software to prove to another party that it has been properly 
instantiated on the platform and by extension is the correct 
software and is securely running inside an enclave on an enabled platform. This attestation does not require the verifier to 
understand the platform software c ontext in which the enclave is 
executing and is limited to trusting the enclave software.  
The Intel® SGX architecture also provides a mechanism to 
obtain a persistent unique key that could be used by the software 
to seal secrets and unseal the secrets later.  The sealing mechanism 
also provides the ability to seam lessly transition secrets when an 
enclave ’s software  is upgraded. 
The attestation and sealing mechanisms, are defined in a 
scalable way that supports a plurality of enclaves running 
simultaneously, each handling its own secrets, and securely 
communicating with remote parties and proving to them that they are in compliancy with their security policies.

Chapter 5: RELATED WORK

Previous hardware additions to microprocessor chips for remote attestation were designed for a single authority managing multiple platforms, which was not easily scalable to support numerous trusted authorities. The Intel® SGX architecture, on the other hand, allows multiple distrusting enclaves to function with complete separation and securely communicate with one or more trusted authorities. The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 1.2 has been implemented in PC platforms and supports attestation and sealing to pre-boot and OS environments. However, this requires secret owners to evaluate the entire platform stack. Intel® SGX significantly reduces the software TCB by including only the enclave software, directly measuring application software, and reducing the attestation evaluation work for secret owners.

Chapter 6: CONCLUSIONS

This paper presents a novel hardware-assisted mechanism in the form of a new ISA extension to Intel® Architecture, which enables secure attestation and sealing to application software running in a secure environment (enclave). The ISA extension allows enclave software to prove its proper instantiation on the platform, ensuring that it is the correct software running securely inside an enclave. Intel® SGX also provides a mechanism for obtaining a persistent unique key for sealing and unsealing secrets, along with the ability to transition secrets seamlessly during enclave software upgrades. The attestation and sealing mechanisms support multiple enclaves running simultaneously, each handling its secrets and securely communicating with remote parties while proving compliance with their security policies.

What does MRSIGNER contain?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

MRSIGNER contains the value that reflects the key or identity of the Sealing Authority that signed the enclave's certificate. In the context of Intel SGX, when sealing to the enclave's Sealing Identity, the EGETKEY instruction bases the key on the value of the enclave's MRSIGNER and the enclave's version. This enables offline migration of sealed data between different versions of the enclave, as long as they are signed by the same Sealing Authority.

**ChatGPT:**

Sealing Identity is not the same as MRSIGNER. However, MRSIGNER is a part of the Sealing Identity. Sealing Identity is a policy used when invoking EGETKEY in Intel® SGX to determine which enclaves can access a sealing key. The Sealing Identity policy is based on the enclave's MRSIGNER value (identity of the Sealing Authority) and the enclave's version. This policy allows for data migration between different versions of enclaves signed by the same Sealing Authority.

What is difference between Sealing Identity and Identity of the Sealing Authority?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The Sealing Identity and the Identity of the Sealing Authority are related but not the same.

Sealing Identity refers to the policy used when invoking the EGETKEY instruction in Intel® SGX to determine which enclaves can access a sealing key. The Sealing Identity is based on the enclave's MRSIGNER value and the enclave's version. This policy allows for data migration between different versions of enclaves signed by the same Sealing Authority.

On the other hand, the Identity of the Sealing Authority is represented by the MRSIGNER value, which reflects the key or identity of the authority that signed the enclave's certificate. The Sealing Authority is responsible for signing enclaves and determining which enclaves can access the same seal key, enabling them to transparently access data that was sealed by other enclaves under their authority.

In summary, the Sealing Identity is a policy based on the MRSIGNER and enclave version, while the Identity of the Sealing Authority is represented by the MRSIGNER value itself.

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, the Sealing Authority can be considered as the enclave builder or the entity responsible for creating and signing enclaves. The Sealing Authority has the necessary cryptographic keys to sign the enclave's certificate, which in turn establishes trust in the enclave's identity and authenticity. The MRSIGNER value reflects the identity of the Sealing Authority, and it is used in sealing policies to determine which enclaves can access the same sealing keys, enabling them to transparently access data that was sealed by other enclaves under the authority's control.

Who can write MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER are values that are generated and populated by the Intel SGX hardware during the enclave creation process.

1. MRENCLAVE: This value is a measurement (hash) of the enclave's code and data. It is generated by the hardware when the enclave is being built and loaded into memory. The MRENCLAVE value is a result of hashing the enclave's content during the build process, and it represents the identity of the specific enclave. No one writes MRENCLAVE directly; it is produced by the hardware as a part of the enclave creation process.

2. MRSIGNER: This value is a measurement (hash) of the public key of the Sealing Authority, which is responsible for signing the enclave's certificate. MRSIGNER is populated by the hardware when the enclave is loaded into memory and is derived from the enclave's signature. The Sealing Authority generates the key pair used for signing the enclave, and during the enclave loading process, the hardware calculates the MRSIGNER value from the public key in the enclave's signature. This value represents the identity of the Sealing Authority.

In summary, MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER are not written by any individual or entity directly; instead, they are generated and populated by the Intel SGX hardware during the enclave creation and loading process.

**ChatGPT:**

SIGSTRUCT is a data structure in Intel SGX that contains the enclave's signature, which is generated by the enclave author or builder during the enclave signing process. The SIGSTRUCT contains the following fields:

1. Header: A constant value identifying the SIGSTRUCT.
2. Vendor: Indicates whether the enclave is a debug or production enclave.
3. Date: The date when the enclave was created.
4. Header2: A constant value representing the second part of the header.
5. SWDefined: Software-defined field, reserved for future use.
6. Reserved1: Reserved field for padding.
7. Modulus: The RSA public key modulus (n) of the enclave signer.
8. Exponent: The RSA public key exponent (e) of the enclave signer.
9. Signature: The RSA signature of the enclave, generated using the enclave signer's private key.
10. MiscSelect: A set of flags indicating which additional information should be included in the enclave measurement.
11. MiscMask: A mask for the MiscSelect field.
12. Reserved2: Reserved field for padding.
13. Attributes: Flags describing various enclave properties.
14. AttributeMask: A mask for the Attributes field.
15. EnclaveHash: The MRENCLAVE value, which is the hash of the enclave's initial state.
16. Reserved3: Reserved field for padding.
17. ISVProdID: The Product ID of the enclave.
18. ISVSVN: The Security Version Number (SVN) of the enclave.
19. Reserved4: Reserved field for padding.
20. Q1, Q2: Two values used in the RSA signature generation process.

These fields are used by the Intel SGX hardware to verify the integrity and authenticity of the enclave during the enclave loading process.

What is Sealing Identity?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The Sealing Identity is a set of criteria in Intel SGX that determines which enclaves can access a specific Sealing Key. These criteria help control the accessibility of sensitive data to future versions of an enclave.

When an enclave needs to store sensitive data securely outside the enclave, it uses the Sealing Key to encrypt and integrity-protect the data. The Sealing Identity specifies the conditions under which a later instantiation of an enclave can access this Sealing Key and decrypt the sealed data.

Intel SGX supports two policies for Sealing Identity:

1. Sealing to the Enclave Identity: This policy bases the Sealing Key on the MRENCLAVE value (the measurement of the enclave's initial state). The key is available to any instance of the exact enclave, and future software versions cannot access the secrets of the original enclave.

2. Sealing to the Sealing Authority Identity (Sealing Identity): This policy bases the Sealing Key on the MRSIGNER value (the measurement of the enclave's signing authority) and the enclave's version. It allows newer enclaves signed by the same Sealing Authority to access data stored by previous versions, enabling data migration between enclave versions.

In summary, the Sealing Identity determines which enclaves can access the Sealing Key based on the selected policy, either by restricting access to the same enclave version or allowing access to newer enclave versions signed by the same Sealing Authority.

What is Sealing Authority?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The Sealing Authority is an entity responsible for signing and endorsing enclaves in the context of Intel SGX. It is typically the enclave developer or an organization that signs and vouches for the integrity and authenticity of the enclave software. The Sealing Authority signs enclaves using its private key, and the corresponding public key is embedded within the enclave to verify its authenticity.

When sealing data to a Sealing Authority Identity (Sealing Identity), the Sealing Key is based on the MRSIGNER value (the measurement of the enclave's signing authority) and the enclave's version. This policy allows newer enclaves signed by the same Sealing Authority to access data stored by previous versions, enabling data migration between enclave versions and ensuring that only trusted and authenticated enclaves can access sensitive data.

**ChatGPT:**

SIGSTRUCT is prepared by the enclave developer or the entity responsible for creating the enclave.

**ChatGPT:**

No, SIGSTRUCT and Sealing Identity are not the same thing. SIGSTRUCT is a data structure that contains the enclave's measurement (MRENCLAVE), the signer's measurement (MRSIGNER), and other metadata related to the enclave, including the signature of the enclave created by the Sealing Authority.

On the other hand, Sealing Identity is a concept that refers to the criteria or policy used to determine which enclaves may access the sealing key generated by the EGETKEY instruction. It is either based on the enclave's identity (MRENCLAVE) or the identity of the Sealing Authority (MRSIGNER).

What is the value of Sealing Identity in the paper?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

In the paper, the Sealing Identity refers to the criteria or policy used to determine which enclaves may access the sealing key generated by the EGETKEY instruction. Intel® SGX supports two policies for Seal Keys:

1. Sealing to the Enclave Identity: This policy is based on the enclave's MRENCLAVE. Any change that impacts the enclave's measurement will yield a different key. This results in a different key for each enclave, providing full isolation between enclaves.

2. Sealing to the Sealing Identity: This policy is based on the enclave's MRSIGNER and the enclave's version. MRSIGNER reflects the key/identity of the Sealing Authority that signed the enclave's certificate. This allows offline migration of sealed data between enclave versions.

The actual value of the Sealing Identity will depend on which policy is chosen and the specific enclave measurements involved.

**ChatGPT:**

In the policy "Sealing to the Enclave Identity," the value of the Sealing Identity is based on the enclave's MRENCLAVE. MRENCLAVE is a unique value that represents the measurement of the enclave's code and data. Any change that impacts the enclave's measurement will yield a different MRENCLAVE value. Thus, the Sealing Identity in this case would be the MRENCLAVE value of the enclave.

Who produces attestation assertion?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

In the context of Intel SGX, the attestation assertion is produced by the enclave software running on the hardware. The enclave generates a data structure called a quote, which contains the attestation information, including the measurement of the enclave (MRENCLAVE) and the enclave's identity. The quote is then typically sent to a remote party (verifier) who evaluates the attestation assertion to determine if they trust the enclave and its execution environment. In some cases, an additional step is involved where the quote is sent to the Intel Attestation Service, which returns a signed attestation report that the verifier can then use to verify the enclave's authenticity.

What is attestation key?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

An attestation key is a cryptographic key used in the process of remote attestation. Remote attestation is a security mechanism that allows a party to verify the integrity and authenticity of a software running in a secure execution environment, such as an Intel SGX enclave.

The attestation key is used to sign the attestation data, which typically includes measurements of the software (e.g., a hash of the software code), the identity of the software, and other relevant information. By signing the attestation data with the attestation key, the software proves that it is running in a secure environment and has not been tampered with. The verifier, who receives the signed attestation data, can then use the corresponding public key to validate the signature and establish trust in the remote software.

How to generate attestation key?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Generating an attestation key typically involves the following steps:

1. Choose a cryptographic algorithm: Select a suitable cryptographic algorithm for the attestation process. Common choices include RSA, ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), or EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm), depending on your security requirements and performance considerations.

2. Generate a key pair: Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to create a private and public key pair for the chosen algorithm. The private key is used for signing the attestation data, while the public key is used by the verifier to validate the signature.

3. Secure the private key: It's crucial to protect the private attestation key from unauthorized access or tampering. In a secure execution environment like Intel SGX, the private key can be generated and stored within the enclave, ensuring that it remains confidential and tamper-resistant. If the key is generated outside the enclave, make sure to securely store it in a hardware security module (HSM) or other secure storage.

4. Distribute the public key: Share the public key with the verifier or other trusted entities that need to validate the attestation data. It's essential to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the public key during transmission, which can be achieved using a secure channel, digital signatures, or public key infrastructure (PKI).

5. Perform remote attestation: Use the private attestation key to sign the attestation data, which typically includes measurements of the software, its identity, and other relevant information. The verifier, who receives the signed attestation data, can then use the public key to validate the signature and establish trust in the remote software.

Remember that the specific steps and requirements for generating an attestation key may vary depending on the secure execution environment, the cryptographic algorithm, and the implementation of the remote attestation protocol.

Is there only one attestation key in a device?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

There isn't necessarily just one attestation key in a device. The number of attestation keys can vary depending on the device's architecture, the security requirements, and the use case.

In some cases, there may be a single attestation key for the entire device, which is used for all remote attestation purposes. This approach can simplify key management but may not provide fine-grained control over the different attestation scenarios.

In other cases, there may be multiple attestation keys within a device, each corresponding to a specific security domain, application, or purpose. For example, Intel SGX enclaves can have unique attestation keys, allowing for independent remote attestation of each enclave.

Using multiple attestation keys can provide more flexibility and fine-grained control over attestation and trust relationships. However, it may also introduce more complexity in key management and distribution.

In general, the choice of using one or multiple attestation keys will depend on factors such as the device's security requirements, the complexity of the system, and the specific use cases that need to be supported.

Where is attestation key sotred in Intel SGX arch?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

In Intel SGX, the attestation key is not directly stored within the enclave. Instead, the enclave uses the Intel Enhanced Privacy ID (EPID) provisioning and attestation services. The EPID private key is securely stored within the platform and is not accessible to the software, including the enclave code itself.

During the remote attestation process, an enclave will generate a quote, which contains information about the enclave's identity, such as MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER, along with a measurement of the enclave's initial state. The quote is signed with the EPID private key, which is handled by the hardware and the SGX-enabled processor's quoting enclave.

The Intel SGX architecture ensures that the attestation key, in this case, the EPID private key, is securely managed and protected by the hardware, making it difficult for an attacker to compromise the key or forge an attestation.

What does REPORT contain? Please list them?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

A REPORT in Intel SGX is a data structure that contains information about an enclave, attesting its identity and integrity. The main components of a REPORT include:

1. MRENCLAVE: A hash representing the enclave's identity and code. It is generated during enclave creation and depends on the enclave's content and initial state.
2. MRSIGNER: A hash of the public key of the enclave's signer, which represents the identity of the Sealing Authority or enclave developer.
3. ISVPRODID: The product ID assigned by the enclave developer.
4. ISVSVN: The security version number assigned by the enclave developer, representing the security-related version or patch level of the enclave.
5. REPORTDATA: A user-defined data field, which can be used to store additional information, such as a challenge-response for the remote attestation process.
6. ATTRIBUTES: Flags indicating properties of the enclave, such as its access permissions, execution modes, or other relevant characteristics.
7. CPU_SVN: A value representing the security version number of the CPU and microcode.
8. MiscSelect: A value specifying the set of miscellaneous properties to include in the measurement.
9. Timestamp: The time at which the REPORT was generated by the CPU.

The REPORT is used as a part of the local and remote attestation processes to prove the identity, integrity, and authenticity of an enclave running on an SGX-enabled platform.

What is MRENCLAVE?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

MRENCLAVE is a hash value that represents the identity and code of an enclave in Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions). It is generated during the enclave's creation process and is based on the enclave's content, initial state, and memory layout.

The MRENCLAVE value is calculated as a hash over the enclave's code and data, including its initial register values, memory layout, and other attributes. This hash uniquely identifies the enclave, as even a small change in the code or data would result in a different MRENCLAVE value.

MRENCLAVE is used in various security mechanisms, such as attestation, sealing, and key management, to ensure that the enclave's integrity and authenticity are maintained. It is included in the REPORT data structure, which is used for local and remote attestation processes to prove the identity, integrity, and authenticity of an enclave running on an SGX-enabled platform.

**ChatGPT:**

An enclave is created by the software running on a system that utilizes Intel SGX technology. The application, or a part of it, that wants to use SGX enclaves for secure execution of sensitive code and data initiates the enclave creation process. During this process, the enclave's code, data, and initial state are loaded into the enclave's protected memory region, and the hardware generates the MRENCLAVE value to uniquely represent the enclave.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, even untrusted software can create an enclave. The primary purpose of Intel SGX is to allow secure execution of sensitive code and data within an enclave, even if the environment outside the enclave is not trusted. The untrusted software can create an enclave, but it cannot access or tamper with the code and data inside the enclave. Once the enclave is created and initialized, only the trusted code inside the enclave can execute and manipulate the data securely.

How to get the MRENCLAVE value of an enclave?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To obtain the MRENCLAVE value of an enclave, you can use the EREPORT instruction provided by Intel SGX. The EREPORT instruction generates a REPORT structure, which includes the MRENCLAVE value of the target enclave. When you call EREPORT, you need to provide the target enclave's targetinfo structure as an input. The targetinfo structure includes the MRENCLAVE value of the target enclave. Once the report is generated, you can extract the MRENCLAVE value from it.

Please note that obtaining the MRENCLAVE value typically involves communication between enclaves or between an enclave and a remote party during the attestation process. In this context, one enclave (reporting enclave) calls the EREPORT instruction to create a report for another enclave (target enclave). The target enclave can then verify the report's authenticity and extract the MRENCLAVE value.

I have enclave A and enclave B. How does enclave A know the enclave B before A wants to get MRENCLAVE value of B?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Before enclave A can get the MRENCLAVE value of enclave B, it needs some knowledge about enclave B. Typically, this knowledge is shared through some out-of-band mechanism or by the application that hosts both enclaves. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. The application creates enclave A and enclave B.
2. The application shares some information about enclave B with enclave A. This could be done by passing the targetinfo structure of enclave B to enclave A, which contains the MRENCLAVE value of enclave B.
3. Enclave A uses the shared information about enclave B to call the EREPORT instruction and generate a report targeting enclave B.
4. The report generated by enclave A is passed to enclave B, either by the application or through some inter-enclave communication mechanism.
5. Enclave B verifies the report's authenticity using the EGETKEY instruction to ensure it comes from enclave A. If the report is valid, enclave B can extract the MRENCLAVE value of enclave A from the report.

Keep in mind that the specific implementation details and communication methods may vary depending on the application's design and security requirements. The above steps are a high-level description of the process.

What is enclave identity described in the paper?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

In the paper, the term "enclave identity" refers to the unique identifier associated with an enclave. The enclave identity is a combination of the MRENCLAVE value, which represents the enclave's code and data, and the MRSIGNER value, which represents the enclave's signer or the entity that signed the enclave.

The enclave identity is used in various security policies, such as attestation and sealing. For example, when an enclave wants to attest its identity to a remote party, it provides a REPORT containing the MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER values as part of the attestation process. Similarly, when sealing data, the sealing policy may be based on the enclave identity to ensure that the sealed data can only be accessed by specific enclaves with matching MRENCLAVE and/or MRSIGNER values.

In summary, the enclave identity in the paper is a combination of MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER values that uniquely identify an enclave, and it is used in various security policies and operations related to attestation and sealing.

What is data structure of enclave identity in C language?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

In C language, the enclave identity can be represented as a struct containing both MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER values. Considering that both MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER are 256-bit values, you can represent them as arrays of 32 bytes (8-bit values). Here's an example of how you can define the enclave identity data structure:

```c
#include <stdint.h>

#define MRENCLAVE_SIZE 32
#define MRSIGNER_SIZE 32

typedef struct {
    uint8_t mrenclave[MRENCLAVE_SIZE];
    uint8_t mrsigner[MRSIGNER_SIZE];
} enclave_identity_t;
```

This `enclave_identity_t` struct contains two arrays, `mrenclave` and `mrsigner`, which store the 256-bit MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER values, respectively. You can use this struct to represent and manipulate the enclave identity in your C code.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

In the paper, the term "enclave identity" refers to the unique combination of MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER values associated with an enclave. MRENCLAVE is the hash of the enclave's initial code and data, while MRSIGNER is the public key of the entity that signed the enclave. Together, these two values provide a unique identifier for the enclave, which can be used for attestation, sealing, and other security-related purposes.

The paper discusses two different sealing policies based on the enclave identity:

1. Sealing to the Enclave Identity: In this policy, the sealing key is derived from the MRENCLAVE value. This means that the sealed data can only be unsealed by an enclave with the same code and data. This policy is useful when you want to restrict access to sealed data to a specific version of an enclave.

2. Sealing to the Sealing Authority: In this policy, the sealing key is derived from the MRSIGNER value. This allows enclaves signed by the same authority to share sealed data, even if their code and data are different. This policy is useful when you want to allow multiple enclaves signed by the same entity to access the same sealed data.

In both cases, the enclave identity plays a crucial role in determining access to sealed data and serves as the foundation for secure enclave communication and data protection.

Where does the paper describe "The enclave identity is a combination of the MRENCLAVE value"?

**ChatGPT:**

Apologies for the confusion earlier. The paper does not explicitly state that "the enclave identity is a combination of the MRENCLAVE value." The paper discusses MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER separately in various contexts.

In the context of sealing data, the paper states the following in section 4.4: "The enclave author can define policies for sealing. Some example policies are sealing to the enclave identity, sealing to the signing identity, sealing to the platform." In this context, the enclave identity refers to MRENCLAVE, and the signing identity refers to MRSIGNER. They are used separately for different sealing policies.

So, the paper does not explicitly define "enclave identity" as a combination of MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER. It refers to them separately for various purposes, and my previous response was incorrect in that regard.

MRSIGNER is generated when an enclave is built and signed. The enclave developer or author writes the enclave code and compiles it. After that, the developer signs the enclave binary using their private key. The MRSIGNER value is the hash of the public key corresponding to the private key used to sign the enclave.

In summary, MRSIGNER is generated by the enclave developer or author during the enclave signing process, and it represents the identity of the enclave signer.

The Intel SGX hardware checks the enclave's signature and other attributes to ensure the enclave is valid and meets the necessary security requirements.

During this process, the Intel SGX hardware will use the information in the SIGSTRUCT to set the MRSIGNER register inside the enclave. The MRSIGNER register will hold the identity of the enclave signer, which can be used for attestation and other security-related purposes.

During the enclave loading and initialization process, the enclave builder provides the SIGSTRUCT to the Intel SGX hardware. The hardware then verifies the SIGSTRUCT to ensure the enclave's authenticity and integrity. This verification process includes checking the RSA signature of the SIGSTRUCT, as well as other attributes and measurements. If the verification is successful, the hardware will allow the enclave to be loaded and initialized, and the enclave can begin secure execution.

**ChatGPT:**

The sentence "The enclave builder presents the hardware with an RSA signed enclave certificate (SIGSTRUCT)" describes a step in the process of creating, loading, and initializing an enclave in the Intel SGX architecture. Let's break down the steps involved:

1. Enclave Creation: The enclave developer writes the enclave code and prepares it for execution in a secure environment provided by the Intel SGX.

2. Enclave Signing: The enclave developer or a trusted authority signs the enclave using a private key, generating a SIGSTRUCT, which is an RSA-signed enclave certificate. The SIGSTRUCT contains important information about the enclave, such as the MRENCLAVE (measurement of the enclave code), MRSIGNER (measurement of the enclave signer), and various attributes.

3. Enclave Loading: The enclave builder prepares the enclave for loading into the SGX-enabled hardware. This includes setting up the memory layout, copying the enclave code into the secure enclave memory, and preparing any necessary data structures.

4. Presenting SIGSTRUCT to Hardware: In the step described by the sentence, the enclave builder presents the hardware with the SIGSTRUCT. This step is necessary for the hardware to verify the authenticity and integrity of the enclave.

5. Verification by Hardware: The Intel SGX hardware verifies the SIGSTRUCT by checking the RSA signature, the MRENCLAVE, the MRSIGNER, and other attributes. If the verification is successful, the hardware determines that the enclave is authentic and has not been tampered with.

6. Enclave Initialization: If the verification is successful, the hardware initializes the enclave, setting up the necessary runtime environment for the enclave code to execute securely.

7. Secure Execution: Once the enclave is initialized, it can begin secure execution within the protected environment provided by the Intel SGX architecture.

What is Sealing Key?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

A Sealing Key is a cryptographic key used in Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions) to protect sensitive data in the context of an enclave. The purpose of the sealing key is to encrypt and decrypt (or "seal" and "unseal") the data, ensuring that it remains confidential and can only be accessed by the enclave that generated the sealing key or other authorized enclaves. 

Sealing keys are derived from a combination of the enclave's identity (MRENCLAVE or MRSIGNER) and the platform-specific key material. This ensures that the sealing keys are unique to a particular enclave and the platform it is running on.

In the Intel SGX architecture, sealing keys are used for the following purposes:

1. Confidentiality: Ensuring that the sensitive data remains confidential and is not accessible to unauthorized entities, including other enclaves, applications, or the operating system.

2. Integrity: Protecting the sensitive data from unauthorized modifications and ensuring that it remains consistent and unaltered.

3. Binding: Tying the sensitive data to a specific enclave or group of enclaves, ensuring that only authorized enclaves can access the data.

The sealing and unsealing processes are critical to the overall security of Intel SGX, as they ensure that sensitive data remains protected even when it is stored outside the secure enclave memory or transmitted between enclaves.

How does "Sealing to the Sealing Identity" work? Please list steps.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

"Sealing to the Sealing Identity" refers to the process of encrypting data with a sealing key that is derived from the enclave's identity. This ensures that the sealed data can only be accessed by the same enclave or other authorized enclaves that share the same identity. Here are the steps involved in this process:

1. Determine the Sealing Identity: The sealing identity is typically a combination of the MRENCLAVE (measurement of the enclave code and data) or MRSIGNER (measurement of the enclave signer) values. It is used as the basis for generating the sealing key.

2. Generate the Sealing Key: The enclave requests a sealing key from the Intel SGX hardware using the EGETKEY instruction. The key is derived from the sealing identity, the platform-specific key material, and the enclave's attributes. This ensures that the sealing key is unique to the enclave and the platform it runs on.

3. Encrypt the Data: The enclave uses the sealing key to encrypt the sensitive data. This process is known as "sealing." It ensures that the data remains confidential and can only be accessed by the enclave that generated the sealing key or other authorized enclaves.

4. Store the Sealed Data: The sealed data can be stored outside the enclave, either in the application's untrusted memory or in a persistent storage location such as a disk file. Since the data is encrypted, it remains protected even when stored outside the secure enclave memory.

5. Unseal the Data: When the enclave or another authorized enclave with the same identity needs to access the sealed data, it follows a similar process to generate the sealing key using the EGETKEY instruction. With the sealing key, the enclave can decrypt and access the sealed data.

6. Verify Integrity: Optionally, the sealing process can also include a message authentication code (MAC) or digital signature to ensure the integrity of the sealed data. During the unsealing process, the enclave verifies the MAC or digital signature to ensure that the data has not been tampered with.

By following these steps, "Sealing to the Sealing Identity" ensures that sensitive data remains confidential and can only be accessed by authorized enclaves that share the same identity. This provides a secure way to store and share data between enclaves and protect it from unauthorized access or tampering.

| Enclave Measurement              | Unique to each enclave build      | Shared by same signer or enclave  |
| Key Derivation                   | Based on MRENCLAVE                | Based on MRENCLAVE or MRSIGNER    |
| Use Case                         | Specific enclave instance         | Enclaves with same identity       |
| Data Accessibility               | Limited to the specific enclave   | Accessible by authorized enclaves |
| Flexibility                      | Lower, tied to a single enclave   | Higher, shared among same identity|
| Software Update Considerations   | Need to migrate data to new MRENCLAVE | Easier with same MRSIGNER         |

In summary, "Sealing to the Enclave Identity" provides more restrictive access to sealed data, ensuring that it can only be accessed by a specific enclave instance. This method is suitable for scenarios where data must be strictly protected and accessible only to that specific enclave.

On the other hand, "Sealing to the Sealing Identity" allows for more flexibility in data access among enclaves with the same identity, which can be based on MRENCLAVE or MRSIGNER. This method is suitable for scenarios where multiple enclaves need to access shared data or when enclaves have a common signer, such as when dealing with software updates or versions.

Does Intel EPID require TPM?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

No, Intel Enhanced Privacy ID (EPID) does not require a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). EPID is a privacy-preserving digital signature scheme developed by Intel, and it is designed to be used independently of a TPM. EPID can provide secure device authentication without revealing unique device identities, which is particularly useful for IoT devices.

EPID and TPM are two separate technologies that can be used for different purposes. TPM is a hardware-based security module that provides a secure environment for storing sensitive data and performing cryptographic operations. It is used for various purposes, such as secure boot, attestation, and key management.

In the context of Intel SGX, EPID is used for remote attestation to prove the integrity and identity of an enclave to a remote party without exposing the unique device identity. While both EPID and TPM can be used for attestation, they are separate technologies and do not depend on each other.

When an enclave is created, the SIGSTRUCT is presented to the hardware by the enclave builder. The hardware then checks the integrity and authenticity of the enclave by verifying the signature in the SIGSTRUCT. The MRSIGNER value in the SIGSTRUCT is used to identify the enclave signer (the enclave's author or authority) and helps to ensure the enclave's integrity and trustworthiness.
