**Question:** `[09:17]` What is RPMB? `(OP-TEE.0327.md)`

**Answer:**

RPMB, or Replay Protected Memory Block, is a security feature found in some eMMC (embedded MultiMediaCard) and UFS (Universal Flash Storage) devices. It is designed to provide a secure, tamper-resistant, and write-protected storage area for sensitive data, like cryptographic keys or device-specific information.

The main characteristics of RPMB include:

1. Replay protection: RPMB uses a counter mechanism to prevent replay attacks. Each write operation to the RPMB partition must include a counter value greater than the current value stored in the RPMB. This ensures that old data cannot be replayed or re-written, protecting against unauthorized modifications.

2. Authentication: RPMB requires that write and read operations be authenticated using a shared secret key, usually derived from a hardware unique key (HUK) or device-specific key. This ensures that only authorized entities can access or modify the data stored in the RPMB partition.

3. Write protection: RPMB partitions are usually write-protected, meaning that once data is written, it cannot be modified or deleted. This ensures the integrity of the stored data and prevents unauthorized tampering.

4. Limited storage capacity: RPMB partitions are typically small in size, as they are intended for storing only critical security-related data.

RPMB is commonly used in devices like smartphones, tablets, and other embedded systems to store sensitive data that requires a higher level of security and protection against tampering or unauthorized access.

**Question:** `[09:18]` What is HS in OP-TEE? `(OP-TEE.0327.md)`

**Answer:**

In the context of OP-TEE, "HS" typically refers to the "Hardware Secure" world or environment. OP-TEE leverages Arm TrustZone technology, which partitions the system into two separate environments: the Normal world (also known as Non-Secure or NS) and the Secure world (also known as Hardware Secure or HS).

The Hardware Secure world is an isolated execution environment where the OP-TEE secure kernel and trusted applications run. This environment provides protection for sensitive data and secure operations, ensuring they are not accessible by the Normal world or vulnerable to tampering. The secure kernel manages the trusted applications, resources, and communication with the Normal world through APIs like the OP-TEE Client API.

In summary, "HS" in OP-TEE refers to the Hardware Secure world, an isolated environment within the Arm TrustZone technology where sensitive data and secure operations are protected from unauthorized access or tampering.

---

**Question:** `[09:19]` What is KEK in OP-TEE? `(OP-TEE.0327.md)`

**Answer:**

In OP-TEE, Key Encryption Keys may be used to protect keys that are stored in the device or used by trusted applications for various security purposes, such as encryption, authentication, or digital signatures. The KEK itself is usually stored in a secure location, like an RPMB partition or within the secure environment provided by OP-TEE, to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.

To summarize, a KEK in OP-TEE is a cryptographic key used to protect other sensitive keys, ensuring their confidentiality and integrity when stored, transmitted, or shared.

---

**Question:** `[13:45]` Does OP-TEE support multi-thread? `(OP-TEE.0327.md)`

**Answer:**

OP-TEE, in its current design, supports multi-threading with certain limitations. The secure world in OP-TEE, which includes the secure kernel and trusted applications, is primarily single-threaded. This means that only one thread can execute at a time within the secure environment, regardless of the number of CPU cores available.

However, OP-TEE does support parallelism in the sense that it allows multiple trusted applications to be loaded and executed concurrently. This is achieved through the use of secure context switching between different trusted applications, ensuring that only one trusted application is active at a time.

It's worth noting that OP-TEE also supports concurrency in the normal world. Multiple normal world applications can communicate with different trusted applications simultaneously, and OP-TEE will manage the context switching between them.

In summary, while OP-TEE's secure environment is primarily single-threaded, it supports parallelism through the use of context switching between multiple trusted applications and concurrent communication with normal world applications.

---

**Question:** `[13:51]` What is secure context switching in TrustZone? `(OP-TEE.0327.md)`

**Answer:**

Secure context switching in TrustZone refers to the process of transitioning between different secure contexts (trusted applications) within the secure world while maintaining isolation and security. ARM TrustZone technology provides a hardware-based separation between the normal world and the secure world, allowing both to run independently and securely.

In the context of OP-TEE and TrustZone, when multiple trusted applications are running or when a normal world application requests a service from a trusted application, the secure kernel manages the execution of these trusted applications by performing secure context switching. This involves:

1. Saving the current context: The secure kernel saves the current state of the active trusted application, including its register values and memory, in a secure location.

2. Restoring the new context: The secure kernel restores the state of the trusted application that is being switched to by loading its previously saved register values and memory.

3. Switching execution: The secure kernel transfers control to the new trusted application, allowing it to continue executing where it left off.

Secure context switching ensures that each trusted application's state is kept separate and secure from others, maintaining isolation and preventing unauthorized access or tampering. Additionally, it allows the secure kernel to manage the concurrent execution of multiple trusted applications and handle requests from normal world applications efficiently.

In summary, secure context switching in TrustZone is the process of managing and transitioning between different trusted applications within the secure world while maintaining isolation, security, and efficient execution.

---

**Question:** `[13:53]` Does OP-TEE support multi-process? `(OP-TEE.0327.md)`

**Answer:**

OP-TEE supports multiple trusted applications (TAs) running concurrently within the secure environment provided by the Arm TrustZone. While the secure world in OP-TEE is primarily single-threaded, it can handle multiple processes in the form of trusted applications.

When multiple trusted applications are loaded and running, OP-TEE manages their execution using secure context switching. This ensures that only one trusted application is active at a time, while maintaining isolation and security between different trusted applications. The secure kernel in OP-TEE is responsible for managing resources, handling requests from the normal world, and switching between the trusted applications as needed.

On the normal world side, multiple processes can communicate with different trusted applications simultaneously, and OP-TEE will manage the context switching between them.

In summary, OP-TEE supports multi-process execution in the form of multiple trusted applications running concurrently within the secure environment, while also allowing multiple normal world processes to communicate with these trusted applications.

---

**Question:** `[13:56]` Can secure kernel and trusted applications in OP-TEE can be multi-thread? `(OP-TEE.0327.md)`

**Answer:**

As of now, the secure kernel and trusted applications in OP-TEE are primarily single-threaded. The secure world in OP-TEE does not support multi-threading within a single trusted application, meaning each trusted application can only execute one thread at a time.

However, OP-TEE does support parallelism in the sense that it allows multiple trusted applications to be loaded and executed concurrently. This is achieved through the use of secure context switching between different trusted applications, ensuring that only one trusted application is active at a time.

Although the secure environment itself is single-threaded, OP-TEE still enables concurrent communication with normal world applications. Multiple normal world applications can communicate with different trusted applications simultaneously, and OP-TEE will manage the context switching between them.

In summary, the secure kernel and trusted applications in OP-TEE are primarily single-threaded, but parallelism is achieved through secure context switching between multiple trusted applications and concurrent communication with normal world applications.

---

**Question:** `[13:57]` Does OP-TEE support IPC? `(OP-TEE.0327.md)`

**Answer:**

Yes, OP-TEE supports Inter-Process Communication (IPC) between trusted applications (TAs) within the secure world and between normal world applications and trusted applications.

1. IPC between trusted applications: Trusted applications in OP-TEE can share data and communicate with each other by invoking other trusted applications. However, the secure kernel must intermediate such communication to ensure isolation and maintain security. Trusted applications use the TEE_InvokeTACommand function to invoke another trusted application and pass data as parameters.

2. IPC between normal world applications and trusted applications: OP-TEE supports communication between normal world applications and trusted applications through the GlobalPlatform TEE Client API. Normal world applications can open a session with a trusted application, invoke commands, and share data with the trusted application while maintaining security.

In both cases, OP-TEE manages the IPC to ensure isolation between different trusted applications and maintain the security of the secure environment. While the communication mechanisms may vary, OP-TEE provides the necessary APIs and infrastructure to support IPC between trusted applications and between normal world applications and trusted applications.

---

**Question:** `[13:59]` Does OP-TEE support shared memory? `(OP-TEE.0327.md)`

**Answer:**

Yes, OP-TEE supports shared memory, which allows normal world applications to share data with trusted applications (TAs) within the secure environment. Shared memory is used for exchanging data between the normal world and the secure world while maintaining security and isolation.

In OP-TEE, shared memory is managed by the GlobalPlatform TEE Client API, which provides functions for allocating, registering, and releasing shared memory. When a normal world application wants to share data with a trusted application, it creates a shared memory buffer using these API functions. The shared memory buffer is then passed as a parameter to the trusted application when invoking a command.

The secure kernel in OP-TEE ensures that the shared memory buffer is accessible by both the normal world application and the trusted application while preventing unauthorized access or tampering. The secure kernel also maintains the isolation between different trusted applications by limiting access to the shared memory buffers associated with each trusted application.

Please note that shared memory in OP-TEE is primarily used for communication between normal world applications and trusted applications. Sharing memory directly between different trusted applications is generally not supported, as it can compromise the isolation and security provided by the secure environment. Instead, trusted applications communicate with each other using the TEE_InvokeTACommand function, as mentioned in a previous answer regarding IPC support.

In summary, OP-TEE supports shared memory for exchanging data between normal world applications and trusted applications while maintaining security and isolation within the secure environment.

---

**Question:** `[14:03]` Please summarize multi-process, IPC, and shared memory of OP-TEE. `(OP-TEE.0327.md)`

**Answer:**

In OP-TEE, multi-process, IPC, and shared memory are features that enable concurrent execution, communication, and data sharing between normal world applications and trusted applications, as well as between trusted applications themselves.

1. Multi-process: OP-TEE supports multiple trusted applications running concurrently within the secure environment. The secure kernel manages the execution of these applications using secure context switching, ensuring that only one trusted application is active at a time while maintaining isolation and security.

2. IPC (Inter-Process Communication): OP-TEE supports communication between trusted applications and between normal world applications and trusted applications. For communication between trusted applications, the TEE_InvokeTACommand function is used. For communication between normal world applications and trusted applications, the GlobalPlatform TEE Client API is used. In both cases, OP-TEE manages the IPC to ensure isolation and maintain security.

3. Shared memory: OP-TEE supports shared memory to allow normal world applications to exchange data with trusted applications securely. The GlobalPlatform TEE Client API manages shared memory buffers, which can be passed as parameters when invoking commands in trusted applications. The secure kernel ensures that the shared memory buffer is accessible by both parties while preventing unauthorized access or tampering.

In summary, OP-TEE provides multi-process support for concurrent execution of multiple trusted applications, IPC for communication between applications, and shared memory for secure data exchange. These features enable efficient and secure interaction between normal world and trusted applications while maintaining isolation and security within the secure environment.

**Question:** `[14:06]` Can secure world can access memory in normal world? `(OP-TEE.0327.md)`

**Answer:**

In general, the secure world in OP-TEE can access memory in the normal world, but it must do so with caution. The secure world has a higher level of privilege, allowing it to access both secure and normal world memory. However, accessing normal world memory from the secure world can introduce potential security risks, such as data leaks or manipulation of sensitive information.

To minimize such risks, OP-TEE employs a set of precautions and guidelines:

1. Use shared memory: When secure world applications need to access data from the normal world, it is recommended to use shared memory, which is explicitly allocated and managed by the GlobalPlatform TEE Client API. This ensures proper isolation and access control for the shared data.

2. Validate memory addresses: If the secure world must access normal world memory directly, it should first validate the memory address range to ensure it doesn't overlap with secure memory or any other protected memory region.

3. Be cautious of data manipulation: The secure world should be aware that normal world memory can be manipulated or tampered with by potentially malicious software running in the normal world. Sensitive operations should not rely solely on data stored in normal world memory without additional validation or protection.

4. Minimize normal world memory access: The secure world should minimize direct access to normal world memory whenever possible and instead rely on secure memory or shared memory buffers for data exchange.

While the secure world in OP-TEE can access normal world memory, it should be done with caution and following proper guidelines to maintain the security and isolation provided by the ARM TrustZone technology.

---

**Question:** `[14:07]` Can normal world access memory in secure world? `(OP-TEE.0327.md)`

**Answer:**

In the context of OP-TEE and Arm TrustZone technology, the normal world cannot directly access the memory in the secure world. The TrustZone technology enforces hardware-based isolation between the normal and secure worlds, which prevents normal world software from accessing or tampering with secure world memory.

The secure world memory, which includes the secure kernel, trusted applications, and their associated data, is protected from unauthorized access by the normal world. This ensures that sensitive data and operations within the secure world remain confidential and secure.

If a normal world application needs to exchange data with a trusted application in the secure world, it must use shared memory, which is explicitly allocated and managed by the GlobalPlatform TEE Client API. This provides a controlled mechanism for data exchange between the normal and secure worlds, maintaining security and isolation.

In summary, the normal world cannot directly access memory in the secure world, thanks to the hardware-based isolation provided by Arm TrustZone technology. Data exchange between the two worlds is facilitated through shared memory, which is managed by the GlobalPlatform TEE Client API.

---

**Question:** `[14:08]` Does OP-TEE support network communication in secure world? `(OP-TEE.0327.md)`

**Answer:**

OP-TEE does not provide built-in support for direct network communication from within the secure world. The main reason for this is to maintain the security and isolation of the secure environment, as exposing networking capabilities directly to the secure world could introduce potential vulnerabilities or attack surfaces.

In most use cases, network communication is handled by normal world applications. If there is a need for secure communication involving trusted applications in the secure world, it is usually done indirectly:

1. Normal world applications handle network communication and exchange data with trusted applications in the secure world using the GlobalPlatform TEE Client API and shared memory.

2. Secure operations, such as encryption, decryption, or authentication, can be performed by trusted applications in the secure world. The normal world application can then send or receive the processed data over the network.

3. If end-to-end security is required, the normal world application can use additional encryption or authentication protocols, in conjunction with secure operations performed by trusted applications.

By handling network communication in the normal world and only exchanging data with the secure world as needed, OP-TEE maintains the isolation and security of the secure environment while still enabling secure network communication indirectly.

In summary, OP-TEE does not support direct network communication within the secure world. Instead, network communication is typically handled by normal world applications, which can securely exchange data with trusted applications in the secure world using the GlobalPlatform TEE Client API and shared memory.

TrustZone is a security technology developed by ARM, which is widely used in modern processors.

TrustZone technology aims to provide a secure execution environment for trusted applications, protecting them from potential security threats posed by untrusted applications. It achieves this by dividing the system into two distinct worlds: the "Secure World" and the "Normal World." These two worlds run concurrently on the same hardware, but they are isolated from each other, ensuring that sensitive data and operations remain protected.

The "Secure World" is designed to handle security-sensitive tasks, while the "Normal World" handles general-purpose tasks. To switch between the two worlds, ARM provides a secure monitor call (SMC) instruction that manages the transitions.

Genode leverages TrustZone technology to enhance the security of its operating system framework. By using TrustZone, Genode can isolate critical parts of the system and applications from the rest of the system, reducing the risk of sensitive data leaks or unauthorized access.

If you have any specific questions about TrustZone or Genode, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help.

**Question:** `[15:32]` An Exploration of ARM TrustZone Technology ... ... `(TrustZone.0329.md)`

**Answer:**

Title: An Exploration of ARM TrustZone Technology

Summary: ARM TrustZone technology is a security solution for ARM-based platforms that introduces a "secure mode" alongside the regular "normal mode." The secure mode establishes a "secure world" and a "normal world" that run concurrently but are isolated from each other, ensuring that sensitive data and operations remain protected. TrustZone is more flexible than TPM chips because its functionality is defined by system software rather than being hard-wired. Despite initial skepticism, TrustZone has gained attention as a marketing term for SoC vendors to promote confidence in their chip's security. The article delves into various aspects of TrustZone, including its rationale, design, implementation, and common questions related to the technology.

**Question:** `[15:33]` Starting point ... ... `(TrustZone.0329.md)`

**Answer:**

Title: Starting Point and Experimentation with ARM TrustZone Technology

Summary: The article discusses the process of choosing a suitable development platform for exploring ARM TrustZone technology. It narrows down to the ARM Versatile Express Cortex-A9 board, an official reference board by ARM. Two lines of experimentation are conducted: prototyping using an existing microkernel and creating a custom kernel platform. Genode OS Framework is used as the foundation for both lines of work, due to its low trusted computing base complexity and high flexibility. The first line of work uses the combination of Genode with Fiasco.OC to enable the principal use of Genode on the platform, while the second line of work supplements Genode with a new base platform called "base-hw" to reduce the TCB complexity of the base system and gain insights into kernel-level problems when using Cortex-A9 and TrustZone.

**Question:** `[15:34]` The design and genesis of our custom base-hw kernel platform ... ... `(TrustZone.0329.md)`

**Answer:**

Title: Design and Genesis of Custom Base-HW Kernel Platform for Genode

Summary: The custom base-hw kernel platform for Genode features a unique hybrid kernel/userland design that simplifies the kernel part, side-steps hard kernel-level problems, and reduces redundancies between kernel and roottask, ultimately resulting in a lower trusted computing base (TCB) complexity. The platform was developed in several steps, including designing and implementing the bootstrapping concept, kernel entry and exit code paths, support for interrupt handling and preemptive multi-threading, core-local context switching, inter-process communication, and user-level device driver mechanisms. This custom kernel platform enabled the execution of real-world application scenarios and provided full coverage of the Genode API.

**Question:** `[15:37]` Hypervisor managing the non-secure world ... ... `(TrustZone.0329.md)`

**Answer:**

Title: TrustZone-Aware Hypervisor for Managing the Non-Secure World

Summary: A TrustZone-aware hypervisor was developed for managing one non-secure virtual machine (VM) and multiple tasks running unprivileged in secure mode. The hypervisor was built upon the custom base-hw kernel platform and involved several steps, including making the kernel TrustZone-aware and constructing a virtual machine monitor (VMM) as a user-level component on top of the kernel. The hypervisor was designed to seamlessly schedule between the non-secure VM and secure tasks, providing a robust and secure foundation for managing different security domains in a TrustZone-enabled system.

**Question:** `[15:38]` World switch between non-secure world and secure world ... ... `(TrustZone.0329.md)`

**Answer:**

Title: World Switch Between Non-Secure and Secure Worlds

Summary: A world switch mechanism was implemented to facilitate transitions between the non-secure and secure worlds in a TrustZone-enabled system. The monitor mode was utilized, which is an execution mode add-on in ARM CPUs with Security Extensions (TrustZone). The system is designed so that all exceptions entering the monitor mode should be triggered only by the non-secure world, simplifying the assembler world-switch routine. The secure world can switch back to the non-secure world through a system call with a pointer to the VM's CPU state, pushing the provided state to the non-secure world.

**Question:** `[17:26]` User-level Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) ... ... `(TrustZone.0329.md)`

**Answer:**

Title: User-Level Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM)

Summary: A new VM-session interface was introduced as a service in Genode's core to enable a client (VMM) to manage the CPU state of a VM, initiate a world switch to the non-secure world, and obtain the VM's state. This allows the creation of a simple VMM that acquires a portion of RAM, loads the VM's ELF binary to physical RAM, and sets the program counter of the VM's CPU state. The VMM enters an endless loop, executing the VM and dumping its CPU state to the debugging console after each exceptional return.

**Question:** `[17:26]` Simple test kernel for the non-secure world ... ... `(TrustZone.0329.md)`

**Answer:**

Title: Simple Test Kernel for Non-Secure World & TrustZone Platform and Address-Space Controller

Summary: A simple test kernel was created to test the VMM setup and the world-switch routine. TrustZone mechanisms were investigated to protect the secure world from the non-secure world. The Versatile Express platform features TrustZone Protection Controller (TZPC) and TrustZone Address Space Controller (TZASC). The TZASC controller is used to secure physical address ranges addressable through the Static Memory Controller (SMC), and the TZPC protects on-chip peripherals and bus accesses to external subsystems. The platform does not allow the partitioning of DDR RAM into secure and non-secure address ranges, but it does host 32 MiB of SRAM that can be preserved for exclusive use by the secure world.

**Question:** `[17:27]` Interrupts ... ... `(TrustZone.0329.md)`

**Answer:**

Title: Interrupts in Secure and Non-Secure Worlds

Summary: Device interrupts can be indirectly partitioned between the secure and non-secure worlds using the ARM architecture's two types of interrupts: normal interrupts (IRQ) and fast interrupts (FIQ). The custom kernel can handle FIQs for the secure world and IRQs for the non-secure world. By defining whether a device's interrupts are delivered as FIQs or IRQs, it is possible to assign individual device interrupts to either the secure or non-secure world. This setup allows secure world device drivers to use FIQs exclusively while IRQs are used by the non-secure world, as expected by the Linux kernel.

**Question:** `[17:28]` Booting Linux in the non-secure world ... ... `(TrustZone.0329.md)`

**Answer:**

Title: Booting Linux in the Non-Secure World with TrustZone

Summary: To boot Linux in the non-secure world using TrustZone, a Linux kernel and a RAM disk must be loaded into memory. The kernel is complemented with ATAGs data structure, which contains essential boot-time information. To ensure security, access to peripherals is granted or denied based on their criticality for the secure world. For devices that must be preserved for the secure world, the Linux kernel code is modified to issue hypercalls instead of directly accessing device resources. The hypervisor reflects these hypercalls to the user-level VMM, which responds to them accordingly.

**Question:** `[17:28]` Device emulation ... ... `(TrustZone.0329.md)`

**Answer:**

Title: Device Emulation in TrustZone's Non-Secure World

Summary: Device emulation in the non-secure world using TrustZone is considered as an alternative to introducing hypercalls. However, trap-and-execute emulation is not feasible due to the latency in reporting access violations. Instead, modifications to the Linux kernel are made by replacing calls to access functions with hypercalls, allowing Linux to boot completely in the non-secure world. A minimal kernel patch was developed to achieve this, only adding 73 lines of code and enabling the successful boot of Linux in the non-secure world.

**Question:** `[17:30]` Additional device drivers ... ... `(TrustZone.0329.md)`

**Answer:**

Title: Implementing Additional Device Drivers and Addressing TrustZone Limitations on i.MX53 SABRE Tablet

Summary: Additional device drivers were required for the ARM TrustZone demonstration on the i.MX53 SABRE tablet, including a framebuffer driver for the LCD display, a touchscreen driver, and a capacitive sensor driver. While developing the framebuffer driver proved to be more complex than anticipated, the touchscreen driver was implemented without major issues. Hardware overlays were employed to allow Android to run at near-native performance in the normal world, but TrustZone implementation limitations regarding the isolation between the Image Processing Unit (IPU) and GPU were discovered. To fix the security hole, the SoC would need to separate the DMA policy of both devices or the secure world would need to virtualize the GPU.

**Question:** `[17:31]` Common questions, answered ... ... `(TrustZone.0329.md)`

**Answer:**

Title: TrustZone Common Questions and Answers

Summary: TrustZone technology is best viewed as an alternative to TPMs rather than as a virtualization solution. It offers versatility and programmability, but it has limitations for compartmentalization, such as only having two worlds, non-virtualized physical addresses, and granularity of access restrictions that depend on the SoC. To host two different compartments or zones (trusted and untrusted), a hypervisor is utilized to set up the non-secure world, load the OS image for the non-secure world, and handle hypercalls from the non-secure OS. In experiments, the Genode OS was used as the hypervisor for this purpose.

**Question:** `[17:32]` Does it make sense to run commodity OSes like Android in the secure world? ... ... `(TrustZone.0329.md)`

**Answer:**

Title: TrustZone and Commodity OSes, ARM's Virtualization Extensions, and Secure Booting

Summary: Running commodity OSes like Android in the secure world of TrustZone is not recommended due to increased complexity and limitations on platforms like the Versatile Express platform. ARM's virtualization extensions, introduced with Cortex-A15, are orthogonal to TrustZone and provide additional capabilities for partitioning systems through the Hyp mode. TrustZone can help securely store secrets by hiding peripherals and memory from the non-secure world and can facilitate secure booting if the SoC supports securely bootstrapping the secure world. The implementation of secure booting and secure storage depends on the SoC used.

**Question:** `[17:40]` What is bootstrap code? `(TrustZone.0329.md)`

**Answer:**

Bootstrap code, also known as boot code, bootloader, or bootstrapping, is a small program responsible for initializing a computer's hardware components and loading the operating system (OS) into memory. When a computer is powered on or restarted, the bootstrap code is the first code to execute, typically stored in a fixed location, such as a Read-Only Memory (ROM) chip, or firmware like Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI).

The primary function of the bootstrap code is to perform hardware checks, initialize essential hardware components (like CPU, memory, and peripherals), and locate the operating system's kernel. Once the kernel is found, the bootstrap code loads it into memory and transfers control to the kernel, enabling the OS to start and manage system resources.

In summary, bootstrap code is responsible for the initial steps in the boot process, laying the groundwork for the operating system to take over and provide a functional environment for the user.
