# Q & A
## TEE.0328.md
**Question:** Can CA and TA be implemented  in other languages?

**Answer:**

Yes, both the Client Application (CA) and the Trusted Application (TA) can be implemented in other programming languages, as long as the language supports interfacing with the required TEE APIs. Many TEE implementations provide APIs and language bindings for multiple programming languages.

For instance, the GlobalPlatform TEE Client API (for the CA) is generally available as a C API, but you can create language bindings for other languages like Python, Java, or Rust. You might need to use the Foreign Function Interface (FFI) or a similar mechanism to interface with the C API from another language.

As for the Trusted Application (TA), the choice of programming languages may be more limited, depending on the TEE implementation and the underlying hardware. Some TAs are typically written in C or C++ for performance and low-level access to hardware features, but there are implementations that support other languages like Rust.

For example, the Rust programming language has gained traction in TEE development, as it provides strong safety guarantees and is suitable for systems programming. There are projects like Teaclave SGX SDK (https://github.com/apache/teaclave-sgx-sdk) for Intel SGX and Rust OP-TEE TrustZone SDK (https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee-rust) for ARM TrustZone, which enable developers to write TAs in Rust.

In summary, while the choice of programming languages for CA and TA might be determined by the specific TEE implementation and hardware, it is possible to use languages other than C or C++ for both normal world and secure world applications.

**Question:** How does TA authenticate request from CA?

**Answer:**

Trusted Applications (TAs) can authenticate requests from Client Applications (CAs) using a variety of mechanisms. One common approach is to establish a secure session between the CA and the TA, which can involve authentication, key exchange, and secure communication. This ensures that only authorized CAs can access the services provided by the TA.

Here are some methods that can be used to authenticate requests from a CA to a TA:

1. **Login Methods**: Different TEE implementations support various login methods to authenticate the origin of the request. GlobalPlatform TEE, for instance, supports multiple login types such as `TEEC_LOGIN_PUBLIC`, `TEEC_LOGIN_USER`, `TEEC_LOGIN_GROUP`, and `TEEC_LOGIN_APPLICATION`. These login types define different levels of trust and can be used to authenticate the CA based on the user, group, or application identity.

2. **Client Authentication**: When a CA opens a session with a TA, it can provide authentication data (e.g., a certificate, a pre-shared key, or a signature) as part of the session's parameters. The TA can verify this authentication data to ensure the CA is authorized to access its services. This can be implemented using custom or standardized cryptographic protocols.

3. **Secure Channels**: The CA and TA can establish a secure communication channel, which provides message confidentiality, integrity, and optionally, replay protection. This can be done by performing a key exchange and using shared secrets to encrypt and authenticate the communication between the CA and the TA.

4. **Attestation**: In some cases, the CA and/or the TA may require additional trust guarantees from the TEE or the platform. This can be achieved through attestation mechanisms, where a trusted third party (e.g., the TEE vendor or the platform owner) vouches for the authenticity and integrity of the TEE, the TA, or the CA. Examples of attestation mechanisms include Intel SGX's remote attestation and ARM TrustZone's secure boot.

The specific method of authentication and the level of trust required between the CA and the TA depend on the use case, the TEE implementation, and the underlying hardware. To ensure the highest level of security, it is essential to choose appropriate authentication mechanisms and follow best practices in implementing them.

## OP-TEE.Intel.0330.md
**Question:** Which isolation method is safe?

**Answer:**

Both Intel Kernel Guard Technology (KGT) and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) provide strong isolation and protection mechanisms, but their safety depends on the specific use case and the implementation.

KGT provides isolation through virtualization technology, using a hypervisor to create isolated virtual machines (VMs). This can provide a strong level of isolation, but it also introduces additional attack surfaces and potential vulnerabilities in the hypervisor layer. The safety of KGT depends on the security of the hypervisor and the underlying hardware, as well as the security of the operating system and applications running within the VMs.

SGX, on the other hand, provides isolation through secure enclaves, which are isolated regions of memory within a process that are protected from access by other processes, the operating system, and even the CPU itself. This provides a strong level of isolation for sensitive data and code, but it also requires careful attention to enclave design and implementation to ensure that potential attack vectors are minimized. The safety of SGX depends on the security of the enclave code, the cryptographic keys used for encryption, and the hardware features that protect against tampering and side-channel attacks.

Overall, both KGT and SGX can provide strong isolation and protection, but their safety depends on the specific use case and the implementation. It is important to carefully evaluate the security and performance implications of using either technology and implement appropriate security measures to mitigate any potential risks.

## OP-TEE.0327.md
**Question:** Which languages do I use to develop apps in OP-TEE or to customize OP-TEE?

**Answer:**

To develop trusted applications for OP-TEE or to customize the OP-TEE framework, you primarily work with the C programming language. Both the OP-TEE OS (the secure kernel) and trusted applications are typically written in C to ensure low-level control, performance, and compatibility with the Arm TrustZone architecture.

1. Trusted Applications: To develop a trusted application (TA) for OP-TEE, you write your application code in C, using the TEE Internal Core API as specified by GlobalPlatform. This API provides functions and types for managing memory, cryptography, secure storage, and other operations within the trusted application.

2. Customizing OP-TEE: If you want to modify or extend the OP-TEE OS itself, you will also work with C. The OP-TEE OS codebase is written in C and can be customized to meet specific requirements or to add new features. However, customizing the OP-TEE OS requires a deeper understanding of the secure kernel's internals and the Arm TrustZone technology.

For normal world applications that communicate with the trusted applications, you can use various programming languages, as long as they can interface with the TEE Client API, which is usually provided as a C library. This means that you can use C, C++, or other languages that support C-compatible FFI (Foreign Function Interface) to interact with the secure world.

To summarize, you primarily use the C programming language to develop trusted applications and customize the OP-TEE framework, while normal world applications can be developed using various programming languages, as long as they can interface with the TEE Client API.

---

**Question:** Can I use other langauges?

**Answer:**

While the primary language for developing trusted applications (TAs) and customizing OP-TEE is C, it is possible to use other languages in some scenarios. However, this usually involves additional steps, and you may need to consider the limitations and compatibility of the chosen language with the TEE environment.

For normal world applications, you have more flexibility in choosing a programming language, as long as it can interface with the TEE Client API. Many popular programming languages have Foreign Function Interface (FFI) capabilities, which allow them to call C functions from native libraries. Some examples of such languages include:

- C++
- Python (using `ctypes` or `cffi`)
- Rust (using `bindgen` or `ctypes`)
- Go (using `cgo`)
- Node.js (using `ffi-napi` or `node-ffi`)

For trusted applications, using a language other than C is more challenging, as it must meet certain requirements, such as being compatible with the TEE environment, the TEE Internal Core API, and the constraints of the secure world. Some potential options include:

1. C++: You may be able to use a subset of C++ to develop trusted applications, as long as you handle low-level details and ensure compatibility with the TEE environment. However, you would need to be cautious about using certain C++ features, such as exceptions and the standard library, which may not be supported or might introduce security risks.

2. Rust: Rust is a systems programming language with strong safety guarantees, which could be suitable for developing trusted applications. There has been some work on using Rust for OP-TEE trusted applications, such as the `rust-optee-trustzone-sdk` project (https://github.com/apache/incubator-teaclave-trustzone-sdk). This project provides a Rust SDK for creating TAs and a set of bindings to the TEE Internal Core API.

Using other high-level languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript for trusted applications is generally not feasible due to their runtime environments, memory management, and performance characteristics, which may not be compatible with the constraints of the secure world.

In summary, while it is possible to use other languages for normal world applications and, to some extent, for trusted applications, the primary language for OP-TEE development remains C. When considering an alternative language, be sure to evaluate its compatibility with the TEE environment, the API, and the specific requirements of your application.

## TrustZone.0329.md
**Question:** Is TrustZone a software or hardware?

**Answer:**

TrustZone is a hardware-based security technology implemented in ARM processors. It provides a security extension that enables the creation of a secure environment alongside the normal environment, isolating the execution of sensitive code and data from potential threats in the normal environment. TrustZone itself is not a software; however, it requires software support to fully utilize its features, such as secure operating systems, trusted applications, and secure bootloaders.

---

**Question:** Can TrustZone replace HSM?

**Answer:**

TrustZone and Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) serve different purposes and have different characteristics. While TrustZone can provide a secure environment for sensitive code execution and data storage, it may not be a direct replacement for HSMs in all use cases.

HSMs are dedicated hardware devices designed to provide robust security for cryptographic operations and key management. They are typically certified to high security standards (such as FIPS 140-2 or Common Criteria) and are resistant to various physical and logical attacks.

TrustZone, on the other hand, is a security extension integrated into ARM processors, which aims to provide a secure environment within the same processor. It is not a separate dedicated hardware device like an HSM. TrustZone can offer a reasonable level of security but may not provide the same level of robustness or certification as an HSM.

In some use cases, TrustZone can be used as a lightweight alternative to an HSM, especially when cost, power consumption, and space are critical factors. However, for applications that require the highest levels of security and assurance, an HSM may still be the preferred choice.

Ultimately, whether TrustZone can replace an HSM depends on the specific security requirements and constraints of the system being designed.

**Question:**

    TEE. Behind this acronym hides the Trusted Execution Environment, a small OS-like environment that sits aside a rich operating system – for instance Android. The purpose of the TEE is to keep all secret credentials and data manipulation in the small TEE rather than in a larger rich OS that is often the vulnerable target of malware and hackers in general. In order to reach this goal, application software is architected in a way such that sensitive functions are precisely defined and offloaded to the TEE in the form of Trusted Applications.
    
    The concept was formalized around 2007 by the OMTP standardization forum, which issued a set of security requirements on functionality a TEE should support. The GlobalPlatform organization went a step further by defining standard APIs: on the one hand, the TEE internal APIs that a Trusted Application can rely on, and on the other hand, the communication interfaces that rich OS software can use to interact with its Trusted Applications. It is worth noting that, because the TEE threat model assumes that nothing coming from the rich OS is trustworthy, the designer of a TA (Trusted Application) must assume that the rich-OS-side client of the TA may not be legitimate. Beyond the APIs, GlobalPlatform also introduced a compliance-testing process to guarantee functional interoperability, and issued a Protection Profile to allow certifying that a TEE meets the necessary security level.
    
    Back in 2009, ST began its work on TEE as part of the ST-Ericsson mobile joint-venture and decided to promote the TEE together with its customers, among which was Nokia, who first introduced the concept in the mobile industry. To this end, a TEE relying on the Arm TrustZone® technology to provide isolation from the rich OS was implemented. The TEE had to fit into a very constrained environment, and TrustZone was key to making it possible as it provides isolation in hardware. Another design choice was made to keep the TEE small and simple: rely on the rich OS to schedule the TEE. This amounts to seeing TAs as extensions of rich OS threads. In other word, the TEE does nothing else than what the rich OS is asking.
    
    Already at that time, the long-term goal was to make the implementation available industry-wide, in order to defragment security implementations in mobile platforms. One key requirement to avoid fragmentation is the support of standards. In 2013, ST-Ericsson obtained GlobalPlatform’s compliance qualification with this implementation, proving that the APIs were behaving as expected in the GlobalPlatform specifications.
    
    At the same time, Linaro was investigating security and especially leverage and promotion of Arm TrustZone. Linaro’s core mandate is to build and maintain the Linux baseport on Arm, integrating the features of Arm cores in Linux. It was therefore quite natural for Linaro to extend its focus by supporting an open-source TEE port on Arm TrustZone, and building security features on it. This provided a clear opportunity to defragment the security ecosystem on Arm-based chipsets. Linaro and ST therefore agreed to collaborate to open-source the TEE.
    
    It has been almost a year since STMicroelectronics, with the full support from Ericsson, and Linaro, have joined forces to succeed in making the TEE, now called OP-TEE, available to the community. Ever since the Linaro Security Working Group was formed in September 2013, Linaro and ST engineers have worked together to revamp the code base, to make it portable, and to remove any legacy or ST-specific code.
    
    OP-TEE is now available on GitHub, at https://github.com/OP-TEE. It consists of three components in separate gits: the normal world user space client APIs (optee_client), a Linux kernel TEE device driver (optee_linuxdriver) and the Trusted OS (optee_os). OP-TEE currently adheres to GlobalPlatform APIs, namely the GlobalPlatform TEE Client API 1.0 and GlobalPlatform TEE Internal API 1.0 specifications, available freely on the GlobalPlatform website. The Trusted OS part is under a BSD license, so that SoC vendors and device manufacturers may modify it without any obligation to disclose the modifications. This choice was key to make OP-TEE usable in commercial products, and thus to build an industry community around OP-TEE. The other major task was the abstraction of platform-specific parts in such a way that it should be fairly easy to port and incorporate OP-TEE in products from different vendors.
    
    OP-TEE architecture with the scope of its three gits
    OP-TEE targets Arm cores and therefore includes a secure monitor code for TrustZone – which is the code executed when the core switches between TrustZone and non-TrustZone modes. We expect that it should still be fairly easy to use OP-TEE on architectures other than Arm TrustZone – for instance on the Cortex-M and Cortex-R range of Arm cores, and therefore further defragment security in embedded electronics, in areas such as Internet of Things or automotive. By releasing OP-TEE to the public, ST and Linaro have provided a seed that will grow from contributions coming from the Arm ecosystem, and especially from Linaro members. An open-source TEE supporting standard interfaces and bringing a community will reduce fragmentation in the way Arm TrustZone is used to everyone’s benefit. We also anticipate that it will foster private and public applied research in security, by giving access to the technology to universities, researchers and governments around the world.

**Answer:**

This article, written by Joakim Bech and published on September 3, 2014, discusses the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), a small OS-like environment that operates alongside a rich operating system (e.g., Android) to protect secret credentials and data manipulation from malware and hackers. The concept of TEE was formalized around 2007 by the OMTP standardization forum, and the GlobalPlatform organization later defined standard APIs to support TEE functionality.

In 2009, ST began working on TEE as part of the ST-Ericsson mobile joint-venture, promoting the technology with its customers, including Nokia. The TEE implementation relied on Arm TrustZone technology for isolation from the rich OS. Keeping the TEE small and simple, the designers relied on the rich OS to schedule the TEE, treating Trusted Applications (TAs) as extensions of rich OS threads.

The goal was to make the implementation available to the entire industry to avoid fragmentation in mobile platform security implementations. In 2013, ST-Ericsson obtained GlobalPlatform compliance qualification for its implementation. Linaro, an organization focused on building and maintaining the Linux baseport on Arm, collaborated with ST to open-source the TEE, now called OP-TEE.

Linaro and ST engineers worked together to revamp the code base, make it portable, and remove any legacy or ST-specific code. OP-TEE is now available on GitHub and adheres to GlobalPlatform APIs. It is under a BSD license, allowing SoC vendors and device manufacturers to modify it without disclosing the modifications. This encourages the creation of an industry community around OP-TEE.

OP-TEE targets Arm cores and includes secure monitor code for TrustZone. It is expected that OP-TEE could be used on architectures other than Arm TrustZone, such as Cortex-M and Cortex-R range of Arm cores, to further reduce fragmentation in embedded electronics security. The release of OP-TEE aims to reduce fragmentation in the way Arm TrustZone is used, benefiting everyone, and fostering private and public applied research in security worldwide.
