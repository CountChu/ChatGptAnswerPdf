<h1>Q &amp; A</h1>
<h2>Boot @ OP-TEE.0327.md</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[09:21]</code> Does OP-TEE OS exist in a single core or multiple cores at run-time?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>At runtime, the OP-TEE OS exists in a single core. It is designed to run on one core at a time in the secure world. However, OP-TEE supports concurrent execution of Trusted Applications (TAs) on different CPU cores. Although the OS itself runs on a single core, it can manage and schedule TAs running on separate cores, ensuring proper execution and isolation.</p>
