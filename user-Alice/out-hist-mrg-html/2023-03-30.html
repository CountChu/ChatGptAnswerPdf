<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[09:30]</code> What are relationships of SPD, SPM and SMC? <code>(TrustZone.0329.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The Secure Partition Manager (SPM), Secure Partition Dispatcher (SPD), and Secure Monitor Call (SMC) are related concepts in the context of ARM TrustZone technology, which provides a secure and isolated environment for sensitive applications and data. Here's a brief explanation of each concept and their relationships:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Secure Monitor Call (SMC): SMC is a special instruction used to switch between the Secure and Non-Secure states in ARM TrustZone. When SMC is executed, the processor transitions to the Secure state, and the Secure Monitor (typically running at S-EL3) is responsible for handling the call. The Secure Monitor can then perform the requested operation or forward the request to a more specific component, such as the SPM or an SPD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure Partition Manager (SPM): The SPM is responsible for managing Secure Partitions (SPs), which are isolated execution environments that host Trusted Applications (TAs) or other secure services. The SPM handles tasks such as creating, initializing, and terminating SPs, as well as managing access to secure resources. When the Non-Secure world needs to access a service provided by an SP, it can use the SMC instruction to request the SPM's assistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure Partition Dispatcher (SPD): The SPD is an optional component that facilitates communication between the Non-Secure world and the Secure world, particularly when using an SMC. The SPD can handle requests from the Non-Secure world, forward them to the appropriate SP, and return the results to the Non-Secure caller. In some implementations, the SPM and SPD can be combined into a single component.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, SMC is an instruction used to transition between Secure and Non-Secure states, while the SPM and SPD are components that manage Secure Partitions and facilitate communication between the two worlds. When an SMC is issued, the request is</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[09:35]</code> What is Secure Monitor? <code>(TrustZone.0329.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The Secure Monitor is a critical component of the ARM TrustZone security technology that acts as an intermediary between the Secure and Non-Secure worlds. It operates at the highest privilege level (S-EL3) within the Secure world, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the Secure environment.</p>
<p>The primary responsibilities of the Secure Monitor include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Handling transitions between Secure and Non-Secure states: When a Secure Monitor Call (SMC) instruction is executed by the Non-Secure world, the processor switches to the Secure state, and the Secure Monitor takes control to process the request. It can either perform the requested operation or forward the request to other components, such as the Secure Partition Manager (SPM) or a specific Secure Partition (SP).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managing resources and access control: The Secure Monitor oversees access to secure system resources, such as memory regions, peripherals, and cryptographic keys, ensuring that only authorized Secure software components can access them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enforcing the security policy: The Secure Monitor is responsible for implementing and enforcing the overall security policy for the system. This includes defining the security boundaries between the Secure and Non-Secure worlds, as well as ensuring that the Secure world remains protected from potential attacks originating from the Non-Secure world.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In essence, the Secure Monitor is a vital component of ARM TrustZone that provides a trusted execution environment for security-sensitive applications and data, while also managing the transitions and interactions between the Secure and Non-Secure worlds.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[09:38]</code> Is SPD an optional component? <code>(TrustZone.0329.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the Secure Partition Dispatcher (SPD) is an optional component within the ARM TrustZone security architecture. The SPD is responsible for managing and scheduling the execution of Secure Partitions (SPs) in the Secure world. It is a more advanced way of handling Secure services compared to the traditional monolithic Secure Monitor, which directly handles Secure world requests.</p>
<p>Using SPD allows for a more modular and flexible approach to implementing Secure services. However, if your use case does not require the functionality provided by Secure Partitions, you can choose not to include the SPD in your system. In that case, you will rely on the Secure Monitor to handle Secure world requests directly or use a different mechanism for managing Secure services.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the choice of whether to include an SPD in your system depends on your specific security requirements and the desired level of flexibility and modularity in your Secure software stack.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[09:40]</code> Can I use SPD instead of SM? <code>(TrustZone.0329.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can use the Secure Partition Dispatcher (SPD) instead of the traditional Secure Monitor (SM) in your ARM TrustZone-enabled system. The SPD provides a more flexible and modular approach to managing Secure services by handling and scheduling the execution of Secure Partitions (SPs) in the Secure world.</p>
<p>When using the SPD, the responsibility for managing Secure services is shifted from the monolithic Secure Monitor to the individual Secure Partitions, which are isolated from each other and can be developed and updated independently.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that this decision depends on your specific security requirements and the desired level of flexibility and modularity in your Secure software stack. If you choose to use the SPD, it will replace the SM as the primary mechanism for managing Secure services in your system.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[09:41]</code> Is normal world a secure parition? <code>(TrustZone.0329.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>No, the Normal World is not a Secure Partition. The Normal World and Secure World are separate execution environments in ARM TrustZone-enabled systems. The Secure World is designed for running security-sensitive code and handling sensitive data, whereas the Normal World is intended for running general-purpose applications and operating systems.</p>
<p>Secure Partitions (SPs) are isolated execution environments within the Secure World. These partitions allow the development and management of security services and Trusted Applications (TAs) independently from each other. They provide additional separation and isolation for sensitive code and data within the Secure World.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Normal World does not provide the same level of protection and isolation as the Secure World and its Secure Partitions, making it unsuitable for hosting security-critical components.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[09:42]</code> Is secure world a secure partition? <code>(TrustZone.0329.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>No, the Secure World is not a Secure Partition, but it contains Secure Partitions. The Secure World is a separate, protected execution environment enabled by ARM TrustZone technology, designed for running security-sensitive code and handling sensitive data.</p>
<p>Secure Partitions (SPs) are isolated execution environments within the Secure World. They provide additional separation and isolation for sensitive code and data, allowing the development and management of security services and Trusted Applications (TAs) independently from each other.</p>
<p>So, while the Secure World provides a protected environment, Secure Partitions offer even more granular isolation within the Secure World itself.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[09:44]</code> Does boot loader only run in secure world, not in normal world? <code>(TrustZone.0329.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Bootloaders can run in both the Secure World and the Normal World, depending on the specific use case and platform. In a secure boot process, the initial bootloader stages run in the Secure World to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the system's firmware and subsequent software components.</p>
<p>Once the initial validation is complete, the bootloader may hand over control to the Normal World, allowing the operating system and applications to boot up and run.</p>
<p>However, in some cases, a bootloader may run entirely in the Normal World if the platform doesn't require secure boot or if the secure boot process is handled differently. Ultimately, whether the bootloader runs in the Secure World or the Normal World depends on the specific hardware, firmware, and security requirements of the system.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[21:56]</code> How to swtich secure world to normal world when booting? <code>(TrustZone.0329.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>When booting a system with TrustZone technology, the processor starts in the Secure World by default. To switch from the Secure World to the Normal World during the boot process, you can follow these general steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Initialize the Secure World</strong>: In the Secure World, the secure bootloader initializes the necessary hardware components, sets up the secure environment, and configures the memory and peripherals access permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Validate and load the Normal World software</strong>: The secure bootloader validates the Normal World software, such as the operating system or bootloader, using cryptographic techniques like digital signatures. Once validation is successful, it loads the software into the memory designated for the Normal World.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configure the processor</strong>: Before switching to the Normal World, the secure bootloader sets up the processor's state, registers, and exception levels. It also configures the system registers, such as the Secure Configuration Register (SCR) and the Monitor Vector Base Address Register (MVBAR), to define the behavior of the system when switching between the Secure World and the Normal World.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Switch to the Normal World</strong>: The secure bootloader performs a Secure Monitor Call (SMC) or an Exception Return (ERET) to switch the processor from the Secure World to the Normal World. This transition is facilitated by the Secure Monitor, which is responsible for handling the state switch between the two worlds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After these steps, the processor enters the Normal World, and the Normal World software, such as the operating system or bootloader, starts executing.</p>
<p>Please note that these steps are a general outline and may vary depending on the specific platform, hardware, and firmware implementations.</p>

<p>For additional information, you can refer to the official OP-TEE documentation at <a href="https://optee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">https://optee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that this is a summary of the instructions provided, and you should follow the detailed steps in the original text to build and integrate OP-TEE successfully.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[10:23]</code> What is GP? <code>(OP-TEE.j721e.0330.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>In the context of the instructions provided, "GP" refers to "General Purpose" devices. When discussing Texas Instruments (TI) processors, the term is used to differentiate between two types of devices: General Purpose (GP) and High Security (HS).</p>
<p>General Purpose (GP) devices are designed for a broad range of applications and use cases. They typically do not include the same level of security features as High Security (HS) devices.</p>
<p>High Security (HS) devices, on the other hand, are designed with additional security features and are intended for use in applications that require a higher level of security, such as automotive systems, industrial control systems, or other safety-critical applications.</p>
<p>When building OP-TEE for a Jacinto 7 Processor, you may need to follow different steps depending on whether you are targeting a General Purpose (GP) or High Security (HS) device. For example, the instructions provided mention signing the tee-pager_v2.bin when building for an HS device, which is not required for a GP device.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[10:24]</code> What is RPMB? <code>(OP-TEE.j721e.0330.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>RPMB stands for Replay Protected Memory Block. It is a security feature provided in eMMC (embedded Multi-Media Controller) and UFS (Universal Flash Storage) devices. RPMB is designed to offer a secure, tamper-resistant storage area for sensitive data and to protect against replay attacks.</p>
<p>In the context of OP-TEE and secure storage, RPMB is used to store sensitive information in a protected environment, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity. It can be used in combination with other secure storage options, such as REE_FS (Rich Execution Environment File System), to create a hybrid storage solution. The hybrid mode uses the Secure Storage directory in the RPMB partition to check for the integrity of the data present in it, providing an added layer of security.</p>
<p>When building OP-TEE with RPMB support, you need to pass additional flags to the build instructions, as mentioned in the provided steps. This enables the use of real eMMC storage instead of the default virtual eMMC storage.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[10:26]</code> What is KEK? <code>(OP-TEE.j721e.0330.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>KEK stands for Key Encryption Key. In cryptography and secure systems, a KEK is used to securely transmit and store encryption keys. The main purpose of a KEK is to protect the actual encryption keys (also known as data encryption keys or DEKs) that are used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data.</p>
<p>The KEK is used to encrypt the DEKs before they are stored or transmitted, and only authorized systems with the correct KEK can decrypt the DEKs to access the actual encryption keys. This adds an additional layer of security, ensuring that even if the encrypted DEKs are intercepted or compromised, an attacker would still need the KEK to decrypt and use them.</p>
<p>In the context of TI SoCs (System-on-Chip) with High Security (HS) configuration, a KEK is embedded in the devices and programmed across OP-TEE instances. Each HS device has its own unique signing key, which is different from other HS devices. This further enhances the security of the overall system, making it more difficult for attackers to compromise the sensitive data stored within.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[10:27]</code> Is a KEK unique for each device? <code>(OP-TEE.j721e.0330.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>In the context of Texas Instruments (TI) System-on-Chip (SoC) devices with High Security (HS) configuration, each device does have a unique KEK (Key Encryption Key). This means that each HS device has its own signing key, which is different from other HS devices. This approach enhances the security of the overall system, making it more difficult for attackers to compromise the sensitive data stored within.</p>
<p>However, it's essential to understand that the uniqueness of a KEK depends on the specific implementation and the security requirements of the system. In some cases, KEKs may be shared among multiple devices or systems to enable secure communication between them.</p>
<p>In summary, while the KEKs in TI SoCs with HS configuration are unique for each device, the uniqueness of KEKs in other systems may vary depending on the specific implementation and security requirements.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[21:42]</code> Intel KGT and Intel SGX. Which one is better? <code>(OP-TEE.Intel.0330.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>It's difficult to say which technology is "better" between Intel Kernel Guard Technology (KGT) and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), as they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.</p>
<p>Intel KGT is a lightweight hypervisor that provides hardware-assisted isolation for virtual machines. It is designed to protect critical system resources in a virtualized environment and is well-suited for use cases such as embedded systems or IoT devices. Its open-source software and ability to deploy on existing systems without additional hardware make it a flexible and versatile option for building secure and efficient virtualized environments.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Intel SGX is a hardware-based security feature that provides protection for code and data in memory from other processes. It is designed to protect against a wide range of threats, including unauthorized access, tampering, and reverse engineering. Intel SGX is well-suited for use cases such as cloud computing, data center security, and edge computing.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the choice between Intel KGT and Intel SGX depends on the specific use case and the type of security requirements that need to be met. In some cases, both technologies may even be used together, as they can complement each other to provide a more comprehensive security solution.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[21:49]</code> What are isolation methods of Intel KGT and Intel SGX? <code>(OP-TEE.Intel.0330.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Both Intel Kernel Guard Technology (KGT) and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) provide isolation mechanisms to protect against unauthorized access and tampering. However, the specific methods of isolation are different for each technology.</p>
<p>Intel KGT provides isolation through virtualization technology, using a hypervisor to create virtual machines (VMs) that are isolated from each other and the host system. The hypervisor uses Intel VT hardware to enforce isolation between the VMs, ensuring that each VM has its own isolated memory space and access to only the resources that have been explicitly granted. This virtualization-based isolation is similar to the isolation provided by other hypervisors such as VMware or Hyper-V.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Intel SGX provides isolation through secure enclaves, which are isolated regions of memory within a process that are protected from access by other processes, the operating system, and even the CPU itself. The memory within an enclave is encrypted and can only be accessed by code that has been trusted and signed by the enclave owner. The enclave also includes hardware protections against tampering, such as sealing and attestation, which further enhance its security.</p>
<p>Overall, both Intel KGT and Intel SGX provide effective isolation mechanisms, but they are used in different contexts and have different strengths and weaknesses. Intel KGT is well-suited for creating secure and isolated virtualized environments, while Intel SGX is designed to protect against a wide range of attacks and provide strong protection for sensitive data and code.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[21:50]</code> Can Intel KGT host Intel SGX? <code>(OP-TEE.Intel.0330.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Intel Kernel Guard Technology (KGT) can host Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) enclaves within a virtual machine (VM). This allows SGX to be used in a virtualized environment while maintaining the security and isolation benefits of both technologies.</p>
<p>To host SGX enclaves within a VM using KGT, the hypervisor creates a VM that is configured with the necessary hardware resources to support SGX, such as Intel VT-x and Intel TXT. Within the VM, the operating system and software can then create and manage SGX enclaves as they would on a non-virtualized system.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that hosting SGX within a VM can impact its performance and security. The additional layer of virtualization can introduce overhead and potential vulnerabilities, and it may not be suitable for all use cases. Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate the security and performance implications of using SGX within a virtualized environment and implement appropriate security measures to mitigate any potential risks.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[21:50]</code> Can Intel SGX host Intel KGT? <code>(OP-TEE.Intel.0330.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>No, Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) cannot host Intel Kernel Guard Technology (KGT).</p>
<p>SGX is a technology that provides secure enclaves within a process to protect code and data from unauthorized access or tampering. The purpose of SGX is to provide a secure execution environment within a process, while KGT is a lightweight hypervisor that provides isolation and protection for virtual machines.</p>
<p>While SGX can be used in a virtualized environment, such as within a virtual machine created by a hypervisor like KGT, it cannot host or provide the functionality of KGT itself. KGT is designed to provide hardware-assisted isolation for virtual machines, while SGX is designed to protect code and data within a process.</p>
<p>Overall, SGX and KGT serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. SGX is well-suited for protecting sensitive code and data within a process, while KGT is well-suited for creating secure and isolated virtualized environments.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[21:43]</code> Be data in memory enclaves must encrypted in Intel SGX? <code>(OP-TEE.Intel.0330.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, data in memory enclaves must be encrypted in Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to provide protection against unauthorized access or tampering.</p>
<p>SGX provides a secure enclave within a process that is isolated from the rest of the process and the system. The enclave is created by the process and is encrypted using keys that are generated by the CPU. Data within the enclave is also encrypted using these keys, which means that even if an attacker gains access to the memory of the process, they cannot access or modify the data within the enclave.</p>
<p>In addition to encryption, SGX also provides other security features such as sealing and attestation. Sealing allows data to be protected and securely transported between enclaves, while attestation verifies the identity and integrity of the enclave to ensure that it has not been tampered with.</p>
<p>Overall, encryption is a critical component of SGX's security features and is essential for protecting data in memory enclaves from unauthorized access or tampering.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[21:46]</code> How do I attack Intel SGX? <code>(OP-TEE.Intel.0330.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Attacking Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a complex task that requires advanced knowledge of the technology and the underlying hardware. While it is not impossible to attack SGX, doing so requires a significant amount of effort and resources. Here are some possible attack vectors that have been identified by security researchers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Side-channel attacks: Side-channel attacks involve measuring physical characteristics of a system, such as power consumption or electromagnetic radiation, to extract sensitive information. SGX is vulnerable to some types of side-channel attacks, such as cache timing attacks and power analysis attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory attacks: Memory attacks involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the memory management of a system to gain access to protected data. SGX is designed to protect against memory attacks, but there have been some vulnerabilities identified in the past, such as the Foreshadow attack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malware attacks: Malware attacks involve infecting a system with malicious software that can bypass SGX protections or steal sensitive data from within the enclave. SGX is not designed to protect against malware attacks, so it is important to ensure that the system is secure and free from malware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical attacks: Physical attacks involve physically tampering with the system to gain access to sensitive information. This type of attack is difficult to execute and requires physical access to the system.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is worth noting that Intel is continually improving SGX and addressing potential vulnerabilities as they are discovered. Regular software updates and security patches should be installed to ensure that the system is protected against known vulnerabilities. Additionally, best practices for secure coding, system hardening, and access control should be followed to reduce the risk of successful attacks.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[21:47]</code> How are data encrypted in memory enclave in Intel SGX? <code>(OP-TEE.Intel.0330.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Data in memory enclaves in Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is encrypted using a combination of hardware and software encryption mechanisms.</p>
<p>When an enclave is created, the CPU generates a unique key pair for that enclave, consisting of a public key and a private key. The private key is stored securely within the CPU and cannot be accessed or modified by software outside of the enclave. The public key is used to establish a secure channel between the enclave and the software outside of the enclave.</p>
<p>Once the secure channel is established, software within the enclave can use standard cryptographic algorithms, such as AES or RSA, to encrypt and decrypt data as needed. The CPU provides hardware support for these cryptographic algorithms, which means that they can be executed within the enclave with minimal performance overhead.</p>
<p>To protect against potential side-channel attacks, SGX also implements various security features, such as randomizing memory locations, encrypting the entire memory space of the enclave, and using secure hashing algorithms.</p>
<p>Overall, the combination of hardware and software encryption mechanisms, along with additional security features, provides strong protection for data in memory enclaves in SGX. However, it is still important to follow best practices for secure coding and system hardening to ensure that the system is protected against potential attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> <code>[21:56]</code> How to swtich secure world to normal world when booting? <code>(TrustZone.0329.md)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>When booting a system with TrustZone technology, the processor starts in the Secure World by default. To switch from the Secure World to the Normal World during the boot process, you can follow these general steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Initialize the Secure World</strong>: In the Secure World, the secure bootloader initializes the necessary hardware components, sets up the secure environment, and configures the memory and peripherals access permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Validate and load the Normal World software</strong>: The secure bootloader validates the Normal World software, such as the operating system or bootloader, using cryptographic techniques like digital signatures. Once validation is successful, it loads the software into the memory designated for the Normal World.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configure the processor</strong>: Before switching to the Normal World, the secure bootloader sets up the processor's state, registers, and exception levels. It also configures the system registers, such as the Secure Configuration Register (SCR) and the Monitor Vector Base Address Register (MVBAR), to define the behavior of the system when switching between the Secure World and the Normal World.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Switch to the Normal World</strong>: The secure bootloader performs a Secure Monitor Call (SMC) or an Exception Return (ERET) to switch the processor from the Secure World to the Normal World. This transition is facilitated by the Secure Monitor, which is responsible for handling the state switch between the two worlds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After these steps, the processor enters the Normal World, and the Normal World software, such as the operating system or bootloader, starts executing.</p>
<p>Please note that these steps are a general outline and may vary depending on the specific platform, hardware, and firmware implementations.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot browse the web or access external links. However, I can try to help answer any questions you may have about the Texas Instruments Jacinto 7 Processor or OP-TEE (Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment).</p>
<p>The Texas Instruments Jacinto 7 Processor is an automotive processor designed for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) applications. It is a System-on-Chip (SoC) solution that integrates multiple processing cores, including Arm Cortex-A72 and Cortex-R5F cores, along with a TI C71x DSP and multiple accelerators for computer vision and deep learning tasks.</p>
<p>OP-TEE (Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment) is an open-source implementation of the TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) for Arm Cortex-A based processors. It provides a secure environment for executing trusted applications isolated from the normal operating system, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data and applications.</p>
<p>If you have any specific questions about these topics, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help.</p>

OP-TEE* for Intel® Architecture
OP-TEE* for Intel® Architecture
Overview	Solution: Two-Virtual Machines (VM)
Overview
This open source trusted execution environment implementation is originally based on Arm TrustZone* and maintained by Linaro*.

OP-TEE* for Intel® Architecture is the hardware virtualization-based OP-TEE solution for x86 systems from Intel. It has a fully compatible design and maximum reuse of OP-TEE. It's a full environment including an operating system, services, and APIs that consist of the following:

Operating system and kernel that:
Supports virtual address space isolation and privilege isolation
Works in event-driven model by request from the Rich Execution Environment (REE)
Drivers for a Linux* kernel
Libraries for client and trusted applications
Hypervisor that uses Intel® Kernel Guard Technology (Intel® KGT), which Intel open sourced in 2015.
Intel KGT
Solution: Two-Virtual Machines (VM)

Original equipment manufacturers (OEM) can develop their own rich operating system client applications and corresponding OP-TEE for Intel Architecture applications and services with the following setup:

One VM runs the OP-TEE operating system and trusted applications. The other VM runs a rich operating system.
Trusted applications are isolated with Intel® Virtualization Technology (Intel® VT) for IA-32, Intel® 64 and Intel® Architecture (Intel® VT-x).
An x86 OP-TEE driver and virtual machine monitor (VMM) from Intel.
A hypervisor (like Intel KGT) creates the two VMs for the rich and OP-TEE operating systems.
