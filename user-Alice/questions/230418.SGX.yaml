    - q: Can I get hardware-protected key by calling EGETKEY instruction in enclave software?
    - q: So after I get the hardware-protected key, I can print it. Is it safe?

Attestation:
  questions:
    - q: What is attestation?
    - q: Please build a cross table. The x axis is hardwared-based and software-based, The y axis is Remote and Local. Please contain Intel SGX, TPM, TLS, SSH, digital signatures, secure boot
    - q: Is secure boot a hardware or software attestation?
    - q: Do you mean that UEFI Secure Boot requires TPM?

Enclave:
  questions:
    - q: What is enclave in Intel SGX?
    - q: Which key is encrypt memory encrypted by?
    - q: How does CPU run code in the encrypted memory in enclave?

    - q: So an untrusted software can also create an enclave. Right?

      from: Papers.SGX.0419.md

    - q: Who generates MRENCLAVE?
      from: Papers.SGX.0419.md

    - q: I have enclave A and enclave B. How does enclave A know the enclave B before A wants to get MRENCLAVE value of B?
      from: Papers.SGX.0419.md

MRSIGNER:
  questions:
    - q: What is MRSIGNER?
