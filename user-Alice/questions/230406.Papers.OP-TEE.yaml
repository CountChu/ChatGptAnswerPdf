    - q: What is Remote Attestation?
    - q: So the software is provided by the remote device and the party verify the signature of the software before run it. Right?
    - q: Is remote attestation only used  to verify software?
    - q: How does a remote device declare that secure boot is enabled?
    - q: But how does the party(verifier) determine if the report is fake if the device is breached?
