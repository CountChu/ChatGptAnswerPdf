CA & TA
    q: How does an  application in normal world request a service with shared memory of a trusted application in a secure world? Please describe the process with APIs.
    q: Which functions are used by TA (trusted application) in the above process?
    q: Could you please draw a sequence diagram of TEEC_InitializeContext, TEEC_OpenSession, TEEC_RegisterSharedMemory, TEEC_InvokeCommand, TEEC_ReleaseSharedMemory, TEEC_CloseSession, TEEC_FinalizeContext, TA_CreateEntryPoint, TA_DestroyEntryPoint, TA_OpenSessionEntryPoint, TA_CloseSessionEntryPoint, TA_InvokeCommandEntryPoint

    q: Which document describe it?
    q: Please give me two sample codes of the above sequence. One is for CA and another is for TA.
    q: Please write sample code of TA again. The code should be complete.
    q: Can CA and TA be implemented  in other languages?
