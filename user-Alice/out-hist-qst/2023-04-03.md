# Q & A
## Boot @ OP-TEE.0327.md
**Question:** `[09:21]` Does OP-TEE OS exist in a single core or multiple cores at run-time?

**Answer:**

At runtime, the OP-TEE OS exists in a single core. It is designed to run on one core at a time in the secure world. However, OP-TEE supports concurrent execution of Trusted Applications (TAs) on different CPU cores. Although the OS itself runs on a single core, it can manage and schedule TAs running on separate cores, ensuring proper execution and isolation.
