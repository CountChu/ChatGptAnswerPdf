The below text comes from chapter 2 in "Arm Firmware Framework for Arm A-profile" document. Chapter 2 Introduction The Armv8.4 architecture introduces the Virtualization extension in the Secure state. The Arm速 SMMU v3.2 architecture \[1\] adds support for stage 2 translations for Secure streams to complement the Secure EL2 translation regime in an Armv8.4 PE. These architectural features enable isolation of mutually mistrusting software components in the Secure state from each other. Isolation is a mechanism for implementing the principle of least privilege: A software component must be able to access only regions in the physical address space and system resources for example, interrupts in the GIC that are necessary for its correct operation. Virtualization in the Secure state enables application of this principle in the following ways: 1. Firmware in EL3 can be isolated from software in S-EL1 for example, a Trusted OS. 2. Firmware components in EL3 can be isolated from each other by migrating vendor-specific components to a sandbox in S-EL1 or S-EL0. 3. Normal world software can be isolated from software in S-EL1 to mitigate against privilege escalation attacks. This specification describes a software architecture that achieves the following goals. 1. Uses the Virtualization extension to isolate software images provided by an ecosystem of vendors from each other. 2. Describes interfaces that standardize communication between the various software images. This includes communication between images in the Secure world and Normal world. 3. Generalizes interaction between a software image and privileged firmware in the Secure state. This software architecture is the Firmware Framework1 for Arm速 A-profile processors. The term Framework and abbreviation FF-A are used interchangeably with Firmware Framework in this specification. This Framework also goes beyond the preceding goals to ensure that the guidance can be used, 1. In the absence of the Virtualization extension in the Secure state. This provides a migration path for existing Secure world software images to a system that implements the Virtualization extension in the Secure state. 2. Between VMs managed by a Hypervisor in the Normal world. The Virtualization extension in the Secure state mirrors its counterpart in the Non-secure state (see also \[2\]). Therefore, a Hypervisor could use the Firmware Framework to enable communication and manage isolation between VMs it manages. More rationale about the introduction of the Virtualization extension in Secure state and goals of the Firmware Framework is provided in the white-paper titled Isolation using virtualization in the Secure world \[3\].

The text you provided comes from the "Arm Firmware Framework for Arm A-profile" document, which describes a software architecture designed to leverage the virtualization extension in the Secure state introduced in the Armv8.4 architecture. This framework, referred to as Firmware Framework or FF-A, aims to improve security and isolation between various software components running on Arm A-profile processors.

The key goals of the FF-A are:

1.  Use the Virtualization extension to isolate software images provided by different vendors from one another.
2.  Standardize interfaces for communication between various software images, including communication between Secure and Normal worlds.
3.  Generalize interactions between a software image and privileged firmware in the Secure state.

Additionally, the FF-A is designed to be used even without the Virtualization extension in the Secure state, providing a migration path for existing Secure world software images. It can also be applied between VMs managed by a Hypervisor in the Normal world, enabling communication and isolation management.

The FF-A helps to create a more secure environment by isolating software components and enabling the principle of least privilege, allowing software components to access only the necessary resources for their correct operation.

The provided text is from Chapter 2 of the "Arm Firmware Framework for Arm A-profile" document. It discusses the introduction of the Virtualization extension in the Secure state in Armv8.4 architecture and the Arm SMMU v3.2 architecture, which together enable better isolation of software components in the Secure state.

The principle of least privilege is applied through the Virtualization extension in the Secure state in the following ways:

1.  Firmware in EL3 can be isolated from software in S-EL1, such as a Trusted OS.
2.  Firmware components in EL3 can be isolated from each other by migrating vendor-specific components to a sandbox in S-EL1 or S-EL0.
3.  Normal world software can be isolated from software in S-EL1 to mitigate privilege escalation attacks.

The Firmware Framework (FF-A) is a software architecture designed to achieve three main goals:

1.  Use the Virtualization extension to isolate software images provided by an ecosystem of vendors from each other.
2.  Describe interfaces that standardize communication between various software images, including communication between images in the Secure and Normal worlds.
3.  Generalize interaction between a software image and privileged firmware in the Secure state.

The FF-A also goes beyond these goals by:

1.  Providing a migration path for existing Secure world software images to a system that implements the Virtualization extension in the Secure state, even in the absence of the Virtualization extension.
2.  Enabling communication and managing isolation between VMs managed by a Hypervisor in the Normal world, since the Virtualization extension in the Secure state mirrors its counterpart in the Non-secure state.

Does Armv8-A has 32 bits?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, Armv8-A architecture includes both 64-bit (AArch64) and 32-bit (AArch32) execution states. The 32-bit execution state in Armv8-A is largely compatible with the Armv7-A architecture, which allows for backward compatibility with existing 32-bit software.

In AArch32 state, Armv8-A processors support the ARM and Thumb instruction sets, which are commonly used in previous 32-bit Arm architectures. This dual execution state design allows Armv8-A based systems to run a mix of 32-bit and 64-bit applications and operating systems, providing flexibility and a smooth transition for software ecosystems.

* * *

**You:**

Does Armv7-A has 64 bits?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

No, Armv7-A architecture does not have 64-bit support. Armv7-A is a 32-bit architecture that was used in many smartphones, tablets, and other devices before the introduction of Armv8-A. Armv7-A supports the ARM and Thumb instruction sets and includes features like NEON SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) and hardware floating-point support.

Armv8-A is the successor to Armv7-A and introduced the 64-bit execution state (AArch64) alongside the 32-bit execution state (AArch32) for backward compatibility with Armv7-A software. The 64-bit support in Armv8-A allows for improved performance, larger addressable memory, and additional architectural enhancements compared to Armv7-A.

**You:**

Can I get Armv8-A with only 32-bit for cost down?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

While the Armv8-A architecture includes both 64-bit (AArch64) and 32-bit (AArch32) execution states, there is no specific variant of Armv8-A that exclusively supports 32-bit operation for cost reduction. The idea behind Armv8-A's dual execution states is to provide compatibility with existing 32-bit software while taking advantage of 64-bit enhancements.

If you are looking for a lower-cost, 32-bit ARM processor option, you may want to consider Cortex-M or Cortex-R series processors. These processors are designed for cost-sensitive, low-power, and real-time applications, respectively.

Cortex-M series processors, in particular, are widely used in microcontroller and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, where power efficiency and lower costs are essential. Cortex-R series processors cater to real-time systems that require fast, deterministic response times and high reliability. While both of these processor families are primarily 32-bit, the Armv8-M architecture for Cortex-M series also introduced a 64-bit variant (Armv8-M Mainline).
