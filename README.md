# ChatGptAnswerPdf
Support python applications that help you generate PDF files from Markdown files of ChatGPT.

## chatpdf.py

The app generates answers of ChatGPT and saves them in HTML and PDF files by running answer.py, tohtml.py, and topdf.py. 

The answers are found in Markdown chat files and organized by your question set files in TXT the-project-specific format.

The chat files are catched by the Chrome plugin [ChatGPT to Markdown](https://chatopenai.pro/chatgpt-to-markdown/) or transformed by chat2md.py from conversations.json.

## chat2md.py

The conversations.json is downloaded from Settings menu of ChatGPT website by clicking "Export data".

## history.py
