# ChatGptAnswerPdf
Support python applications that can help you convert your ChatGPT conversations from Markdown files into HTML and PDF files.

# Applications

## chatpdf.py

The app generates answers of ChatGPT and saves them in HTML and PDF files by running answer.py, tohtml.py, and topdf.py. 

The answers are found in Markdown chat files and organized by question set files with extension yaml in a YAML format.

The chat files are captured by the Chrome plugin [ChatGPT to Markdown](https://chatopenai.pro/chatgpt-to-markdown/) or converted by chat2md.py from conversations.json.

## chat2md.py

The app converts conversations.json into Markdown files compatible to the plugin [ChatGPT to Markdown](https://chatopenai.pro/chatgpt-to-markdown/).

The conversations.json is downloaded from Settings menu of ChatGPT website by clicking "Export data".

## history.py

The app generates answers in Markdown files for each date. The answers come from all question set files answered by chat files or all chat files.

# Usage
