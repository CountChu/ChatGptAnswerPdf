# ChatGptAnswerPdf
The project converts ChatGPT conversations from Markdown files into HTML and PDF files. You can: 
1) organize ChatGPT conversations by your question set files.
2) delete unused conversations which are specified in config.yaml.
3) Daily report conversations. 

# Applications

## chat2md.py

The app converts conversations.json into Markdown files which are compatible to the Chrome plugin, [ChatGPT to Markdown](https://chatopenai.pro/chatgpt-to-markdown/).

The conversations.json is downloaded from Settings menu of ChatGPT website by clicking "Export data".
> ChatGPT > Settings & Beta > Data controls > Export data. 

## chatpdf.py

The app generates answers of ChatGPT and saves them in HTML and PDF files by running the tool chain: 
> answer.py, subl_markdownPreview_save.py, and topdf.py. 

```
answer.py:                      chats(md), questions(yaml) ---> out-ans(md)
subl_markdownPreview_save.py:   out-ans(md) --> out-ans-html
topdf.py:                       out-ans-html ---> out-ans-pdf
```

The answers are extracted from chat files (\*.md) and organized by question set files (\*.yaml).

The chat files (\*.md) are converted by chat2md.py from conversations.json or  captured by the Chrome plugin [ChatGPT to Markdown](https://chatopenai.pro/chatgpt-to-markdown/).

## history.py

The app generates answers in Markdown files for each date. The answers come from all question set files answered by chat files or all chat files.
