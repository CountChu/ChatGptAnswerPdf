The below text are chapter 2 of "Arm Firmware Framework for Arm A-profile"  Chapter 2 Introduction The Armv8.4 architecture introduces the Virtualization extension in the Secure state. The Arm® SMMU v3.2 architecture [1] adds support for stage 2 translations for Secure streams to complement the Secure EL2 translation regime in an Armv8.4 PE. These architectural features enable isolation of mutually mistrusting software components in the Secure state from each other. Isolation is a mechanism for implementing the principle of least privilege: A software component must be able to access only regions in the physical address space and system resources for example, interrupts in the GIC that are necessary for its correct operation. Virtualization in the Secure state enables application of this principle in the following ways: 1. Firmware in EL3 can be isolated from software in S-EL1 for example, a Trusted OS. 2. Firmware components in EL3 can be isolated from each other by migrating vendor-specific components to a sandbox in S-EL1 or S-EL0. 3. Normal world software can be isolated from software in S-EL1 to mitigate against privilege escalation attacks. This specification describes a software architecture that achieves the following goals. 1. Uses the Virtualization extension to isolate software images provided by an ecosystem of vendors from each other. 2. Describes interfaces that standardize communication between the various software images. This includes communication between images in the Secure world and Normal world. 3. Generalizes interaction between a software image and privileged firmware in the Secure state. This software architecture is the Firmware Framework1 for Arm® A-profile processors. The term Framework and abbreviation FF-A are used interchangeably with Firmware Framework in this specification.  This Framework also goes beyond the preceding goals to ensure that the guidance can be used, 1. In the absence of the Virtualization extension in the Secure state. This provides a migration path for existing Secure world software images to a system that implements the Virtualization extension in the Secure state. 2. Between VMs managed by a Hypervisor in the Normal world. The Virtualization extension in the Secure state mirrors its counterpart in the Non-secure state (see also [2]). Therefore, a Hypervisor could use the Firmware Framework to enable communication and manage isolation between VMs it manages. More rationale about the introduction of the Virtualization extension in Secure state and goals of the Firmware Framework is provided in the white-paper titled Isolation using virtualization in the Secure world [3].

Chapter 2: Introduction

The Armv8.4 architecture introduces the Virtualization extension in the Secure state, and the Arm® SMMU v3.2 architecture adds support for stage 2 translations for Secure streams. These features enable the isolation of mutually mistrusting software components in the Secure state, thereby implementing the principle of least privilege. Virtualization in the Secure state allows for the isolation of firmware in EL3 from software in S-EL1, firmware components in EL3 from each other, and normal world software from software in S-EL1.

This specification outlines a software architecture called the Firmware Framework for Arm® A-profile processors (also referred to as FF-A), which aims to:

1. Use the Virtualization extension to isolate software images provided by different vendors.
2. Standardize interfaces for communication between various software images in the Secure and Normal worlds.
3. Generalize interactions between a software image and privileged firmware in the Secure state.

The Framework also provides guidance for systems without the Virtualization extension in the Secure state and for communication between VMs managed by a Hypervisor in the Normal world. This ensures a migration path for existing Secure world software images and allows Hypervisors to use the Firmware Framework for communication and isolation management between VMs.

More information about the introduction of the Virtualization extension in the Secure state and the goals of the Firmware Framework can be found in the white paper titled "Isolation using virtualization in the Secure world".

The below text are chapter 3 of "Arm Firmware Framework for Arm A-profile"  The Firmware Framework is made up of the following building blocks as illustrated in Figure 3.1. 1. Isolation boundaries. 2. Partition interfaces. 3. Partitions. 4. Partition manifest. 5. Partition manager. The following sub-sections describe these building blocks in more detail.

**ChatGPT:**

Chapter 3: Building Blocks of the Firmware Framework

The Firmware Framework for Arm A-profile consists of five main building blocks, as shown in Figure 3.1:

1. Isolation Boundaries
2. Partition Interfaces
3. Partitions
4. Partition Manifest
5. Partition Manager

The following sub-sections provide more details about these building blocks:

1. Isolation Boundaries: These boundaries separate and protect software components from one another, ensuring that they cannot access each other's resources without proper authorization. This helps to maintain the principle of least privilege and provides a secure environment for software execution.

2. Partition Interfaces: These interfaces standardize communication between software components within the Secure and Normal worlds. They enable the exchange of information and requests between partitions, ensuring that components can communicate effectively while maintaining isolation.

3. Partitions: Partitions are the individual software components that run within the framework. They can include firmware, trusted operating systems, or other secure services. Each partition is isolated from the others and operates within its own environment, with access to only the resources it needs to function properly.

4. Partition Manifest: The Partition Manifest is a metadata file that describes the properties and requirements of a partition. It includes information such as the partition's entry points, memory requirements, and other resources it needs to function. The Partition Manager uses this manifest to configure and manage the partition within the system.

5. Partition Manager: The Partition Manager is a critical component of the Firmware Framework, responsible for managing partitions and their associated resources. It oversees the lifecycle of partitions, including their creation, execution, and termination. The Partition Manager also ensures that partitions are properly isolated and that they only have access to the resources defined in their Partition Manifest.

The below text are chapter 3.1 of "Arm Firmware Framework for Arm A-profile". Please summarize it.  3.1 Isolation boundaries The Framework defines two types of isolation boundaries. 1. A Logical isolation boundary that can be used to, 1. Isolate one software module e.g. a library or a device driver from another within a software image in an exception level through an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED mechanism. One or more services implemented inside a module are accessed through a IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED application programming interface (API). 2. Isolate one software image from another by, 1. Deploying them in separate exception levels. 2. Deploying them in the same exception level. The images are temporally isolated from each other on a given PE. One or more services implemented inside a software image are accessed through an application binary interface (ABI). 2. A Physical isolation boundary that can be used to spatially isolate the physical address space of one software image from another through the following mechanisms. 1. The Arm® TrustZone Security extension. It is used to protect the Secure physical address space ranges assigned to software images in the Secure state from software images in the Non-secure state. 2. Virtual memory-based memory protection provided by the Arm A-profile VMSA. It is used to protect the physical address space ranges assigned to a software image from other software images in the same security state. The Framework assumes that a physically isolated software image is logically isolated as well. For example, • A Guest OS running inside a VM is both physically and logically isolated from a Guest OS in another VM. • A Hypervisor running in EL2 is both physically and logically isolated from all VMs it manages. • Firmware in EL3 is physically and logically isolated from any software image in the Normal world. The Framework does not assume that a logically isolated software image is physically isolated as well. For example, a Trusted OS in S-EL1 is logically but not physically isolated from firmware in EL3 when any of the following scenarios apply. 1. S-EL2 is not present i.e. ID_AA64PFR0_EL1.SEL2=0. 2. S-EL2 is not enabled on the system by setting SCR_EL3.EEL2=1. 3. S-EL2 is present and enabled but Stage 2 address translation in the Secure EL1&0 translation regime is disabled i.e. HCR_EL2.VM=0. The two images are not physically isolated since software in S-EL1 can access the physical address space of software in EL3. The Framework defines ABIs that enable communication between software images across an exception level boundary. The images are logically isolated and could be physically isolated as well.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Chapter 3.1: Isolation Boundaries

The Firmware Framework defines two types of isolation boundaries: logical isolation and physical isolation.

1. Logical Isolation Boundary: This boundary can be used to isolate software modules (e.g. libraries or device drivers) within a software image in an exception level or to isolate software images from one another. These services can be accessed through an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED API or an application binary interface (ABI).

2. Physical Isolation Boundary: This boundary is used to spatially isolate the physical address space of one software image from another. It relies on mechanisms such as the Arm® TrustZone Security extension and the Arm A-profile VMSA to protect the physical address space ranges assigned to software images.

The Framework assumes that a physically isolated software image is also logically isolated but does not assume that a logically isolated software image is physically isolated. The Framework defines ABIs that enable communication between software images across an exception level boundary, allowing for logical and potential physical isolation.

The below text are chapter 3.2 of "Arm Firmware Framework for Arm A-profile". Please summarize it.  3.2 Partitions A partition is defined as a software module or image that implements one or more services within an isolation boundary such that a service is accessible across the boundary only via well defined interfaces. If the partition is a software image, then the well defined interface is an FF-A ABI. If the partition is a software module, the well defined interface is an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED API. The Framework defines ABIs that partitions can invoke at their exception level boundaries for the following purposes. 1. Discover the presence of a partition, its properties and services it implements. 2. Synchronous and asynchronous message passing between partitions. 3. Memory management between partitions. A partition that is logically isolated but not physically isolated is called a logical partition. A partition that is both physically and logically isolated is called a physical partition. The term partition is used when it is not required to distinguish between a logical and physical partition. The term endpoint is used interchangeably with the term partition. 1. A VM (when the virtualization extension is enabled) or the OS kernel (when the virtualization extension is disabled or unavailable) is a physical or logical endpoint that runs in EL1 in the Non-secure security state. These endpoints are called NS-Endpoints in scenarios where it is not necessary to distinguish between them. 2. A partition in the Secure security state is called a Secure Partition (SP) and could be, 1. A logical partition that runs in EL3, S-EL2 or S-EL1. 2. A physical partition that runs in S-EL1 or S-EL0. SPs are called S-Endpoints in scenarios where it is not necessary to distinguish between them on the basis of the exception level they run in. A partition manifest describes the physical address space ranges and system resources a partition needs, identity of partition services to enable their discovery and other attributes of the partition that govern its run-time behavior (also see Chapter 5 Setup).

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Chapter 3.2: Partitions

A partition in the Firmware Framework is a software module or image that implements one or more services within an isolation boundary. These services are accessible across the boundary only via well-defined interfaces, such as FF-A ABIs for software images and IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED APIs for software modules.

The Framework defines ABIs for partitions to discover other partitions, their properties, and services, as well as for synchronous and asynchronous message passing and memory management between partitions.

Partitions can be logical (logically isolated but not physically isolated) or physical (both physically and logically isolated). The term "endpoint" is used interchangeably with "partition." There are two types of endpoints:

1. NS-Endpoints: VMs or OS kernels running in EL1 in the Non-secure security state. These can be either physical or logical partitions.
2. S-Endpoints: Secure Partitions (SPs) in the Secure security state, which can be logical partitions running in EL3, S-EL2, or S-EL1, or physical partitions running in S-EL1 or S-EL0.

A partition manifest describes the required physical address space ranges, system resources, partition services, and other attributes governing the partition's run-time behavior.

The below text are chapter 3.3 of "Arm Firmware Framework for Arm A-profile". Please summarize it.  3.3 Partition manager A partition manager is responsible for creating and managing the physical isolation boundary of a partition. It uses a partition manifest to assign physical address space ranges and system resources to a partition, initialize it as per the specified attributes and enable discovery of its services. The partition manager also implements FF-A ABIs to enable inter-partition communication for access to partition services. 1. In the Secure world, this component is called the Secure Partition Manager (SPM). 2. In the Normal world it is a Hypervisor1 (if the virtualization extension is enabled). A partition manager is physically isolated from physical partitions and logically isolated from logical partitions it manages. All partitions managed by a partition manager reside at the same or a numerically lower exception level than the partition manager. The term partition manager is used in the rest of this specification to collectively refer to the SPM and Hypervisor in scenarios where they have the same responsibilities, and it is not necessary to distinguish between them. The Hypervisor uses the virtualization extension in the Arm A-profile VMSA to create physical isolation boundaries as follows. • The EL1&0 stage 2 translation regime, when EL2 is enabled in a PE in the Non-secure state, is used to restrict visibility of the Non-secure physical address space from a VM to only those regions that have been assigned to the VM. See 4.1 SPM architecture for a description of how the SPM creates and manages isolation boundaries for SPs. See 4.2 DMA isolation for a description of how a partition manager creates and manages isolation boundaries for DMA capable devices. The following trust boundaries are defined by the Firmware Framework vis-a-vis the partition managers and partitions. • The SPM is a part of the TCB for a system resource or physical address space range assigned to the Secure state. • Both the Hypervisor and SPM are a part of the TCB for a system resource or physical address space range assigned to the Non-secure state. • A VM trusts the Hypervisor to protect its resources from other VMs by creating and maintaining the correct physical isolation boundaries in the Non-secure physical address space. • Every endpoint trusts the SPM to protect its resources from other endpoints by creating and maintaining the correct physical isolation boundaries in both the Secure and Non-secure physical address spaces. • An SP does not trust the state of any Non-secure resource it has access to. Therefore, it does not trust the Hypervisor or a NS-Endpoint that could also access the same resource. The term FF-A component is used to collectively refer to partitions and partition managers.

Chapter 3.3: Partition Manager

The Partition Manager is responsible for creating and managing the physical isolation boundary of a partition. It uses a partition manifest to assign resources to a partition, initialize it, and enable the discovery of its services. The Partition Manager also implements FF-A ABIs for inter-partition communication. In the Secure world, this component is called the Secure Partition Manager (SPM), while in the Normal world, it is a Hypervisor.

A Partition Manager is physically isolated from physical partitions and logically isolated from logical partitions it manages. The term "partition manager" is used to refer to both the SPM and Hypervisor when their responsibilities are the same.

The Hypervisor uses the virtualization extension in the Arm A-profile VMSA to create physical isolation boundaries, while the SPM does so for SPs. The Firmware Framework defines trust boundaries concerning partition managers and partitions. The SPM is part of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) for resources assigned to the Secure state, and both the Hypervisor and SPM are part of the TCB for resources assigned to the Non-secure state. VMs trust the Hypervisor, and all endpoints trust the SPM to protect their resources. However, an SP does not trust the state of any Non-secure resource it has access to, and therefore does not trust the Hypervisor or a NS-Endpoint that could also access the same resource. The term "FF-A component" is used to refer to partitions and partition managers collectively.

The below text are chapter 3.4 of "Arm Firmware Framework for Arm A-profile". Please summarize it.  3.4 Example configurations The Non-secure and Secure security states in the Arm A-profile architecture typically adopt a client-server model where a partition in the Non-secure state is a client of services implemented by a partition in the Secure state. Partitions within a security state could adopt the client-server model as well. Furthermore, a partition can be both a consumer of another partition’s services and provider of its own services. The FF-A software architecture generalizes the programming model to access a partition’s services within and between the Non-secure and Secure security states. Some example deployment scenarios of the FF-A software architecture on various configurations of an Arm A-profile system are listed in the following sub-sections.  3.4.1 FF-A deployment without S-EL2 Figure 3.2: Example FF-A deployment without S-EL2 In Figure 3.2, the virtualization extension is enabled in the Non-secure state. It is either unavailable or disabled in the Secure state. Both VM0 and VM1 implement an FF-A driver in EL1 to access services in S-Endpoints. They could use the same driver to access each other’s services as well. The Hypervisor facilitates access to services in S-Endpoints from VM0 and VM1 by implementing an FF-A driver in EL2. It could use the same driver to enable them to access each other’s services. The following software images are deployed in the Secure world. 1. A firmware image in EL3. It implements the SPM. 2. A firmware image in S-EL1 (SP1). 3. A Trusted OS image in S-EL1 (SP0). SP0 and SP1 are temporally isolated logical partitions and could access each other’s services via the SPM. The SPM is logically isolated from SP0 and SP1.  3.4.2 FF-A deployment with S-EL2 Figure 3.3: Example FF-A deployment with S-EL2 In Figure 3.3, the virtualization extension is enabled in both security states. The Normal world software stack in unchanged from Figure 3.2. The following software images are deployed in the Secure world. 1. A firmware image in EL3. 2. An SPM image in S-EL2. 3. A firmware image in S-EL1 (SP1). 4. A Trusted OS image in S-EL1 (SP0). SP0 and SP1 are physical partitions and could access each other’s services via the SPM. The SPM is physically isolated from SP0 and SP1.  3.4.3 FF-A deployment with S-EL2 and Armv8.1-VHE Figure 3.4: Example FF-A deployment with S-EL2 and Armv8.1-VHE In Figure 3.4, the virtualization extension is enabled in both security states.

The following software images are deployed in the Secure world. 1. A firmware image in EL3. 2. An SPM image in S-EL2. 3. A firmware image in S-EL0 (SP1). 4. A firmware image in S-EL0 (SP0). SP0 and SP1 are physical partitions that could access each other’s services. The SPM is physically isolated from SP0 and SP1.

Chapter 3.4: Example Configurations

The Arm Firmware Framework for Arm A-profile can be deployed in various configurations on an Arm A-profile system. The programming model is generalized to access a partition's services within and between the Non-secure and Secure security states. Some example deployment scenarios are:

3.4.1 FF-A deployment without S-EL2:
In this scenario, the virtualization extension is enabled in the Non-secure state, but unavailable or disabled in the Secure state. VM0 and VM1 use FF-A drivers to access services in S-Endpoints. The Hypervisor facilitates access to these services. In the Secure world, a firmware image in EL3 implements the SPM, and firmware images in S-EL1 (SP1) and a Trusted OS image in S-EL1 (SP0) are deployed as temporally isolated logical partitions.

3.4.2 FF-A deployment with S-EL2:
In this scenario, the virtualization extension is enabled in both security states. The Normal world software stack remains unchanged from the previous example. In the Secure world, a firmware image in EL3, an SPM image in S-EL2, a firmware image in S-EL1 (SP1), and a Trusted OS image in S-EL1 (SP0) are deployed. SP0 and SP1 are physical partitions that can access each other's services via the SPM, which is physically isolated from them.

3.4.3 FF-A deployment with S-EL2 and Armv8.1-VHE:
In this scenario, the virtualization extension is enabled in both security states, and Armv8.1 VHE is enabled in the Secure world to manage S-EL0 SPs. The Normal world software stack remains unchanged from the first example. In the Secure world, a firmware image in EL3, an SPM image in S-EL2, and firmware images in S-EL0 (SP1 and SP0) are deployed. SP0 and SP1 are physical partitions that can access each other's services, and the SPM is physically isolated from them.

In ARM partition manager, Whan A is isolated from B. Could I say that B is also isolated from A?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, in the ARM partition manager, when partition A is isolated from partition B, it means that B is also isolated from A. Isolation boundaries ensure that both partitions cannot directly access each other's resources, providing security and stability for each partition's operation.

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, I am sure. In the ARM Firmware Framework, isolation boundaries are designed to prevent unauthorized access between partitions. When partition A is isolated from partition B, it implies that both partitions are protected from each other, and neither partition can access the other's resources without proper authorization. So, when A is isolated from B, it also means that B is isolated from A.

Can SPM see SP0 and SP1?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, the Secure Partition Manager (SPM) can "see" and manage both SP0 and SP1. The SPM is responsible for creating and managing the physical isolation boundaries of Secure Partitions (SPs) like SP0 and SP1. It uses partition manifests to assign resources, initialize the partitions, and enable discovery of their services. Additionally, the SPM implements FF-A ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces) to enable inter-partition communication for access to partition services. So, while the SPM isolates SP0 and SP1 from each other, it still has visibility and control over both partitions.

Can SP0 or SP1 see SPM?

**ChatGPT:**

In the ARM Firmware Framework, SP0 and SP1 can communicate with the Secure Partition Manager (SPM) through well-defined interfaces, such as FF-A ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces). While the SPM is physically isolated from SP0 and SP1 in scenarios where they are physical partitions, they can still interact with the SPM using these interfaces for communication, service discovery, and memory management.

However, it is important to note that SP0 and SP1 cannot access the internal workings or the memory of the SPM directly. They can only communicate with the SPM through the defined interfaces, ensuring that the isolation between them is maintained.

**ChatGPT:**

TrustZone isolation boundary is a form of physical isolation. TrustZone is a security extension in ARM architecture that separates the processor's resources, such as memory and peripherals, into two distinct security domains: the Secure world and the Non-secure world. By utilizing hardware-based isolation, TrustZone ensures that sensitive data and functions in the Secure world are protected from unauthorized access by software running in the Non-secure world.

The below text are chapter 4.1 of "Arm Firmware Framework for Arm A-profile". Please summarize it.  4.1 SPM architecture The responsibilities of the SPM are split between two components: the SPM Dispatcher (SPMD) and SPM Core (SPMC). Both components have access to the entire physical address space and are a part of the Trusted computing base. The term SPM is used when it is not necessary to distinguish between these two components. The responsibilities of these components are listed below. 1. The SPMD resides in EL3 and runs in either the AArch64 or AArch32 execution state. It is responsible for: • SPM Core initialization at boot time. • Forwarding FF-A calls from Normal world to the SPM Core. • Forwarding FF-A calls from the SPM Core to the Normal world. 2. The SPMC either co-resides with the SPMD in EL3 or in an adjacent exception level i.e. S-EL1 or S-EL2. It is responsible for: • SP initialization and isolation at boot time. • Inter-partition isolation at run-time. • Inter-partition communication at run-time between: – S-Endpoints. – S-Endpoints and NS-Endpoints. Table 4.1 lists the SPMC and SPMD configurations supported by the Framework vis-a-vis the exception levels they can reside in and the execution states they can run in.

EL3 (AArch64) S-EL2 (AArch64) S-EL2 SPMC In SPM configurations where the SPMD and SPMC reside in adjacent exception levels, • They implement and report a mutually compatible version of the Firmware Framework. See 13.2.3 SPM usage for details. • The mechanism used by the SPMD to initialize the SPMC is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED. The guidance provided in Chapter 5 Setup could be used by the implementation. • They use the ABIs defined in this specification for communication. A description of each SPM configuration is provided in the following sections. • 4.1.1 Secure EL2 SPM core component. • 4.1.3 EL3 SPM core component. • 4.1.2 S-EL1 SPM core component. The SPM configurations without S-EL2 are used in the following scenarios. • Reduce the size of the TCB by migrating EL3 & S-EL1 firmware components, that should not be a part of the TCB, to one or more physically isolated S-EL0 SPs. • Make the TCB implementation more robust by migrating its components from EL3 & S-EL1 to one or more physically isolated S-EL0 SPs. • Adopt the generalized programming model specified by the Framework to ease the migration of the Secure world software stack to an Arm A-profile system with S-EL2 enabled. • Adopt the generalized programming model specified by the Framework for accessing services in S-Endpoints from NS-Endpoints irrespective of whether S-EL2 is used in the Secure world.  4.1.1 Secure EL2 SPM core component Figure 4.1: Example S-EL2 SPM Core and SP configuration The S-EL2 SPMC is fundamental to enforcing the principle of least privilege in the Secure state on Armv8.4 or later systems as described in Chapter 2 Introduction. It supports one or more of the following SP configurations. 1. The SPMC uses Armv8.1 VHE to manage one or more physical SPs that run in S-EL0. Each SP runs in either the AArch32 or AArch64 execution state. The physical address space assigned to an SP is isolated from other FF-A components through the single stage of address translation implemented by the Secure EL2&0 translation regime. 2. The SPMC manages one or more physical SPs that run in S-EL1. Each SP runs in either the AArch32 or AArch64 execution state. The physical address space assigned to an SP is isolated from other FF-A components by the Secure EL1&0 stage 2 translation regime, when EL2 is enabled. An example of these configurations is illustrated in Figure 4.1.  4.1.2 S-EL1 SPM core component Figure 4.2: Example S-EL1 SPM Core and SP configuration A S-EL1 SPMC runs in either the AArch64 or AArch32 execution state. It supports one or more of the following SP configurations. 1. The SPMC manages one or more physical SPs that run in S-EL0. Each SP runs in either the AArch32 or AArch64 (only if S-EL1 SPMC runs in AArch64 too) execution state. The physical address space assigned to an SP is isolated from other FF-A components through the single stage of address translation implemented by the Secure EL1&0 translation regime in either execution state. 2. The SPMC manages a single SP that also runs in S-EL1. The SPMC and SP are packaged in the same software image and logically isolated from each other. In this configuration: • The interface between the SPMC and the SP component is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED for example, a set of C programming language APIs. • Any FF-A calls targeted to the SP from the Normal world must be received by the SPMC and forwarded to the SP component through the IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED interface. • The SPMC and SP are initialized through an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED mechanism. See Chapter 5 Setup for more information. Figure 4.2 illustrates a combination of these configurations.  4.1.3 EL3 SPM core component The EL3 SPMC co-exists with the SPMD in either the AArch64 or AArch32 execution state. It supports one of the following mutually exclusive SP configurations. Figure 4.3: Example EL3 SPM Core and S-EL0 SP configuration 1. One or more physical SPs that run in S-EL0. Each SP runs in either the AArch32 or AArch64 (only if EL3 SPMC runs in AArch64 too) execution state. The physical address space assigned to an SP is isolated from other FF-A components through the single stage of address translation implemented by the Secure EL1&0 translation regime. This configuration is illustrated in Figure 4.3.  Chapter 4. Concepts 4.1. SPM architecture Figure 4.4: Example EL3 SPM Core and S-EL1 SP configuration 2. The SPMC and SPMD co-exist in EL3 in the AArch64 execution state. One or more logical SPs reside in S-EL1. Each SP runs in either the AArch32 or AArch64 execution state. The SPs are temporally isolated from each other by the SPMC. This configuration is illustrated in Figure 4.4.

**ChatGPT:**

Chapter 4.1 of the "Arm Firmware Framework for Arm A-profile" discusses the Secure Partition Manager (SPM) architecture. The SPM is divided into two components: the SPM Dispatcher (SPMD) and the SPM Core (SPMC). Both components are part of the Trusted Computing Base and have access to the entire physical address space. 

The SPMD resides in EL3 and is responsible for the SPM Core initialization at boot time, forwarding FF-A calls between the Normal world and the SPM Core. The SPMC can reside in EL3, S-EL1, or S-EL2 and is responsible for SP initialization and isolation at boot time, inter-partition isolation, and inter-partition communication between S-Endpoints and NS-Endpoints.

The document describes various SPM configurations based on the exception levels and execution states of the SPMD and SPMC. It also provides examples of these configurations for Secure EL2 SPM core component, S-EL1 SPM core component, and EL3 SPM core component.

These configurations are essential for enforcing the principle of least privilege, reducing the size of the Trusted Computing Base, making the TCB implementation more robust, and adopting the generalized programming model specified by the Framework.

When to enable secondary cores?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Secondary cores are typically enabled after the primary core has successfully initialized the system and started the operating system. The exact process for enabling secondary cores can vary depending on the hardware and operating system being used. Here is a general outline of when secondary cores are enabled:

1. Power on the system, and the primary core initializes hardware components and executes the bootloader (e.g., Trusted Firmware-A for Arm-based systems).

2. The bootloader loads and starts the operating system on the primary core.

3. The operating system initializes its kernel, essential components, and device drivers on the primary core.

4. After the primary core has completed its initialization, the operating system enables the secondary cores. This process is often referred to as "core bring-up" or "CPU hotplug."

5. The operating system assigns tasks or processes to the secondary cores, allowing them to participate in executing applications and system processes.

It is important to note that the specific process for enabling secondary cores depends on the hardware platform, firmware, bootloader, and operating system in use. Some systems may require additional configuration or software support to enable secondary cores.

What is fip.bin?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

`fip.bin` (Firmware Image Package) is a binary file used in Arm Trusted Firmware-A (TF-A) for packing multiple firmware images into a single file. It is used as a part of the boot process in Arm-based systems, particularly in the context of Armv8-A architecture.

The `fip.bin` file typically contains a collection of firmware images, such as:

1. BL1 (First Level Bootloader): Responsible for initial platform setup and loading BL2.
2. BL2 (Second Level Bootloader): Responsible for loading BL3x images.
3. BL3-1 (EL3 Runtime Firmware): Provides runtime services, such as PSCI (Power State Coordination Interface), to the lower ELs (Exception Levels).
4. BL3-2 (Trusted OS Firmware): The Secure-EL1 Payload, typically the TrustZone-based OS or a secure monitor.
5. BL3-3 (Non-Trusted Firmware): The Non-secure-EL1 Payload, usually the main OS bootloader like U-Boot or GRUB.

The `fip.bin` file is created using the `fiptool` utility provided by Arm Trusted Firmware. The tool combines the various firmware images into a single binary, which can then be loaded and executed by the platform's bootloader during the boot process. This approach simplifies firmware management and distribution while also enabling the bootloader to locate and authenticate the required images more easily.
