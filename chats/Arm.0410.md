The below text comes from chapter 2 in "Arm Firmware Framework for Arm A-profile" document.  Chapter 2 Introduction The Armv8.4 architecture introduces the Virtualization extension in the Secure state. The Arm® SMMU v3.2 architecture [1] adds support for stage 2 translations for Secure streams to complement the Secure EL2 translation regime in an Armv8.4 PE. These architectural features enable isolation of mutually mistrusting software components in the Secure state from each other. Isolation is a mechanism for implementing the principle of least privilege: A software component must be able to access only regions in the physical address space and system resources for example, interrupts in the GIC that are necessary for its correct operation. Virtualization in the Secure state enables application of this principle in the following ways: 1. Firmware in EL3 can be isolated from software in S-EL1 for example, a Trusted OS. 2. Firmware components in EL3 can be isolated from each other by migrating vendor-specific components to a sandbox in S-EL1 or S-EL0. 3. Normal world software can be isolated from software in S-EL1 to mitigate against privilege escalation attacks. This specification describes a software architecture that achieves the following goals. 1. Uses the Virtualization extension to isolate software images provided by an ecosystem of vendors from each other. 2. Describes interfaces that standardize communication between the various software images. This includes communication between images in the Secure world and Normal world. 3. Generalizes interaction between a software image and privileged firmware in the Secure state. This software architecture is the Firmware Framework1 for Arm® A-profile processors. The term Framework and abbreviation FF-A are used interchangeably with Firmware Framework in this specification.  This Framework also goes beyond the preceding goals to ensure that the guidance can be used, 1. In the absence of the Virtualization extension in the Secure state. This provides a migration path for existing Secure world software images to a system that implements the Virtualization extension in the Secure state. 2. Between VMs managed by a Hypervisor in the Normal world. The Virtualization extension in the Secure state mirrors its counterpart in the Non-secure state (see also [2]). Therefore, a Hypervisor could use the Firmware Framework to enable communication and manage isolation between VMs it manages. More rationale about the introduction of the Virtualization extension in Secure state and goals of the Firmware Framework is provided in the white-paper titled Isolation using virtualization in the Secure world [3].

**ChatGPT:**

The text you provided comes from the "Arm Firmware Framework for Arm A-profile" document, which describes a software architecture designed to leverage the virtualization extension in the Secure state introduced in the Armv8.4 architecture. This framework, referred to as Firmware Framework or FF-A, aims to improve security and isolation between various software components running on Arm A-profile processors.

The key goals of the FF-A are:

1. Use the Virtualization extension to isolate software images provided by different vendors from one another.
2. Standardize interfaces for communication between various software images, including communication between Secure and Normal worlds.
3. Generalize interactions between a software image and privileged firmware in the Secure state.

Additionally, the FF-A is designed to be used even without the Virtualization extension in the Secure state, providing a migration path for existing Secure world software images. It can also be applied between VMs managed by a Hypervisor in the Normal world, enabling communication and isolation management.

The FF-A helps to create a more secure environment by isolating software components and enabling the principle of least privilege, allowing software components to access only the necessary resources for their correct operation.

2. Firmware components in EL3 can be isolated from each other by migrating vendor-specific components to a sandbox in S-EL1 or S-EL0.
3. Normal world software can be isolated from software in S-EL1 to mitigate privilege escalation attacks.

The Firmware Framework (FF-A) is a software architecture designed to achieve three main goals:

1. Use the Virtualization extension to isolate software images provided by an ecosystem of vendors from each other.
2. Describe interfaces that standardize communication between various software images, including communication between images in the Secure and Normal worlds.
3. Generalize interaction between a software image and privileged firmware in the Secure state.

Does Armv8-A has 32 bits?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, Armv8-A architecture includes both 64-bit (AArch64) and 32-bit (AArch32) execution states. The 32-bit execution state in Armv8-A is largely compatible with the Armv7-A architecture, which allows for backward compatibility with existing 32-bit software.

In AArch32 state, Armv8-A processors support the ARM and Thumb instruction sets, which are commonly used in previous 32-bit Arm architectures. This dual execution state design allows Armv8-A based systems to run a mix of 32-bit and 64-bit applications and operating systems, providing flexibility and a smooth transition for software ecosystems.

* * *

**You:**

Does Armv7-A has 64 bits?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

No, Armv7-A architecture does not have 64-bit support. Armv7-A is a 32-bit architecture that was used in many smartphones, tablets, and other devices before the introduction of Armv8-A. Armv7-A supports the ARM and Thumb instruction sets and includes features like NEON SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) and hardware floating-point support.

Armv8-A is the successor to Armv7-A and introduced the 64-bit execution state (AArch64) alongside the 32-bit execution state (AArch32) for backward compatibility with Armv7-A software. The 64-bit support in Armv8-A allows for improved performance, larger addressable memory, and additional architectural enhancements compared to Armv7-A.

**You:**

Can I get Armv8-A with only 32-bit for cost down?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

While the Armv8-A architecture includes both 64-bit (AArch64) and 32-bit (AArch32) execution states, there is no specific variant of Armv8-A that exclusively supports 32-bit operation for cost reduction. The idea behind Armv8-A's dual execution states is to provide compatibility with existing 32-bit software while taking advantage of 64-bit enhancements.

If you are looking for a lower-cost, 32-bit ARM processor option, you may want to consider Cortex-M or Cortex-R series processors. These processors are designed for cost-sensitive, low-power, and real-time applications, respectively. 

Cortex-M series processors, in particular, are widely used in microcontroller and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, where power efficiency and lower costs are essential. Cortex-R series processors cater to real-time systems that require fast, deterministic response times and high reliability. While both of these processor families are primarily 32-bit, the Armv8-M architecture for Cortex-M series also introduced a 64-bit variant (Armv8-M Mainline).

**You:**

How do I specify the execution states (64-bit, 32-bit) of Armv8-A?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

In Armv8-A architecture, the execution state (64-bit or 32-bit) is determined by the Exception Level (EL) and the current mode of operation. The Armv8-A processors have four Exception Levels (EL0 to EL3), with EL0 being the least privileged and EL3 being the most privileged.

To specify the execution state:

1. AArch64 (64-bit): When operating in AArch64 state, all Exception Levels (EL0 to EL3) use 64-bit general-purpose registers and execute 64-bit instructions. The operating system and applications running on an Armv8-A processor in AArch64 state will be 64-bit.

2. AArch32 (32-bit): In AArch32 state, the processor operates in a manner compatible with the Armv7-A architecture. The processor will use 32-bit general-purpose registers and execute 32-bit ARM or Thumb instructions. In AArch32 state, there are two modes of operation, ARM and Thumb, with Thumb being a more compact instruction set.

In most cases, the choice of execution state is determined by the operating system and firmware during system initialization. Modern operating systems, such as Linux or Android, running on Armv8-A processors typically use the AArch64 state for better performance and memory addressing capabilities.

When writing assembly code or configuring a bootloader, you may need to specify the execution state explicitly. In assembly code, you can use directives like `.arch armv8-a` for AArch64 and `.arch armv8-a+nofp` for AArch32. In bootloader configuration, you may need to select the appropriate options to set the target execution state.

In summary, the execution state of an Armv8-A processor is determined by its current mode of operation and Exception Level. Operating systems and firmware typically handle the choice of execution state during system initialization, but you may need to specify it explicitly when writing low-level code or configuring bootloaders.

**You:**

How do I specify AArch32 and AArch64 of Armv8-A?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

In Armv8-A, the execution state (AArch32 or AArch64) is determined by the Exception Level (EL) at which the processor is operating. To specify the execution state for Armv8-A, you need to configure the system during startup or when switching between exception levels. The initial execution state and switch between states are managed by low-level firmware or the operating system.

Here's an overview of how to specify the AArch32 and AArch64 execution states:

1. When the system starts, the processor begins at the highest available exception level (usually EL3) in the AArch64 state. The firmware initializes the system and configures the desired execution state for each exception level.

2. To switch the execution state for a specific exception level, you need to modify the appropriate system control register. For example, when switching from EL3 to EL1, the firmware can set the appropriate bit in the SCR_EL3 register to configure the processor to enter AArch32 or AArch64 state at EL1.

   - To set AArch64 state for EL1: Set the SCR_EL3.EA bit to 0 (AArch64 state)
   - To set AArch32 state for EL1: Set the SCR_EL3.EA bit to 1 (AArch32 state)

3. When configuring a hypervisor at EL2, you can use the HCR_EL2 register to set the execution state for lower exception levels (EL1 and EL0):

   - To set AArch64 state for EL1: Set the HCR_EL2.RW bit to 1 (AArch64 state)
   - To set AArch32 state for EL1: Set the HCR_EL2.RW bit to 0 (AArch32 state)

Please note that these configurations are usually done by the system firmware or the operating system during startup or when transitioning between exception levels. Modifying these settings requires a deep understanding of the system and the Armv8-A architecture to ensure correct operation.

I found that when arm is in aarch32 state, only a few exceptions can switch to aarch64 depending on the configuration in the registers. the exceptions are as follows.  abort, physical async abort, physical FIQ and physical IRQ  while other exceptions are still processed in aarch32 state.  My questions are as follows.  Q1: Is my understanding correct?  Q2: If Q1 is yes, why these exceptions can be processed and others can not such as underfined instruction, svc, hvc?  Q3: What is the usage case for switch between aarch32 and aarch64?  In addition, exception return from higher exception level after reset can switch to aarch32, right?  cray  All Replies Answers Oldest Newest Martin Weidmann Offline Martin Weidmann over 7 years ago I found that when arm is in aarch32 state, only a few exceptions can switch to aarch64 depending on the configuration in the registers.  That isn't strictly correct.  Any exception could potentially cause a change of Execution state.  There are various reasons you might want to switch between the states.  A good example is a 64-bit OS, hosting a mix of 32-bit and 64-bit apps.  If you are currently running one of the 32-bit apps and you take an exception (e.g. IRQ, SVC from a system call, abort from a page fault,....) you enter the 64-bit OS.  So a AArch32 --> AArch64 transition.  When the OS performs an exception return back into the app, that's an AArch64-->AArch32 transition.  Up0Down cray Offline cray over 7 years ago in reply to Martin Weidmann Hi Martin,  Thanks for your answer.  you said Any exception could potentially cause a change of Execution state. But I read all the exception processing pseudocode in aarch32. the variable route_to_aarch64 only exists in a few exceptions such as abort. look at the following pseudocode.  if route_to_aarch64 then  AArch64.Abort(ZeroExtend(vaddress), fault);  Only the abort, physical async abort, physical FIQ and physical IRQ exceptions have this pseudocode. How do you explain this condition? Thanks.  cray  Up0Down Martin Weidmann Offline Martin Weidmann over 7 years ago in reply to cray I should have been a little more precise.  Any exception type in AArch32 state could potentially lead to Execution state changing to AArch64.  No exception taken while in AArch64 will result in Execution state changing to AArch32.  For exceptions returns the reverse is true.  An exception return in AArch64 might cause execution state to change to AArch32.  No exception return in AArch32 can lead to Execution state changing to AArch64(\*).  For both exceptions and exception returns, a change of Execution state can only occur if there is also a change in EL.  That is an exception from EL0 to EL1 could lead to a change in Execution state.  But an exception from EL1 to EL1 could not.  Let's take one example of an exception not on your list.  The pseudo code for the A32/T32 for SVC says:  if ConditionPassed() then   EncodingSpecificOperations();   AArch32.CallSupervisor(imm32<15:0>); Following the chain down:  AArch32.CallSupervisor(bits(16) immediate)    ...   if AArch32.GeneralExceptionsToAArch64() then     AArch64.CallSupervisor(immediate);   else     AArch32.TakeSVCException(immediate); So based on on the return value of GeneralExceptionsToAArch64(), either the AArch32 or AArch64 pseudo code gets called.  Looking at GeneralExceptionsToAArch64():  boolean AArch32.GeneralExceptionsToAArch64()   return ((PSTATE.EL == EL0 && !ELUsingAArch32(EL1)) ||           (HaveEL(EL2) && !IsSecure() && !ELUsingAArch32(EL2) && HCR_EL2.TGE == '1')); So the conditions for SVC are:  * Taking SVC from EL0 to EL1, where EL1 is using AArch64 (defined by either SCR_EL3.RW or HCR_EL2.RW depending on Security state)  * Taking SVC from NS.EL0/NS.EL1 when EL2 is using AArch64 (defined by SCR_EL3.RW) and HCR_EL2.TGE==1  (\*) Well, maybe indirectly.  The exception return might trigger an exception, and the exception might cause a switch to AArch64.  But it is the exception, not the exception return, which is actually causing the Execution state change.  Up0Down Michael Williams Offline Michael Williams over 7 years ago in reply to cray To further expand on Martin's response, for the synchronous exceptions this "interworking" layer exists before the pseudocode function for taking the exception (TakeXXXException). So functions like AArch32.Abort and AArch32.CallSupervisor as in Martin's examples. For the asynchronous exceptions there is a layer of implied pseudocode that is not in the manual. This for instance includes the checks whether the asynchronous exception is masked. However, since this layer of code does not appear in the manual, the route_to_aarch64 is included in the TakeXXXException() function. So it is there for the asynchronous exceptions, but not the synchronous ones.  Up0Down cray Offline cray over 7 years ago in reply to Michael Williams Dear Martin and Michael,  Thanks very much for your response. This question troubled me for a long time. The architecture manual is so long that I have not read all of it.  I should dig into it to find more information. Now I'm very happy to get the right answer.  cray  Up0Down

**ChatGPT:**

The discussion in the linked forum post provides a deeper insight into how execution states can be switched between AArch32 and AArch64 in ARMv8-A architecture.

To summarize the key points from the discussion:

1. Any exception type in AArch32 state could potentially lead to the execution state changing to AArch64. However, no exception taken while in AArch64 will result in the execution state changing to AArch32.

2. For exception returns, an exception return in AArch64 might cause the execution state to change to AArch32. No exception return in AArch32 can lead to the execution state changing to AArch64, except indirectly through triggering another exception that causes the switch.

3. A change of execution state can only occur if there is also a change in Exception Level (EL). For example, an exception from EL0 to EL1 could lead to a change in the execution state, but an exception from EL1 to EL1 could not.

4. The ARMv8-A architecture manual provides pseudocode for handling various exceptions and switching between AArch32 and AArch64 states. The manual can be referred to for understanding the specific conditions for each type of exception.

The exact mechanism for switching between AArch32 and AArch64 execution states depends on the exception type and the system configuration, and can be found in the ARMv8-A architecture manual.

How do I specify only AArch32 of Armv8-A at run-time?

**ChatGPT:**

In ARMv8-A architecture, you can use the Execution state (AArch32 or AArch64) depending on the current Exception Level (EL) and the settings of specific configuration registers. Here's how you can ensure the system operates in AArch32 mode at runtime:

1. Configure the relevant registers:
   - If you are in the Secure state, you need to set the `SCR_EL3.RW` bit to 0.
   - If you are in the Non-secure state, you need to set the `HCR_EL2.RW` bit to 0.

2. When executing in the context of an OS or hypervisor, ensure that your software configures the registers correctly to maintain the AArch32 mode. This might include configuring the `SCTLR_ELx` register and other system registers as needed.

3. When running applications, ensure they are compiled for AArch32 mode. When an exception occurs (e.g., an interrupt or a system call), and the system transitions to a higher EL, it will remain in AArch32 mode if the settings mentioned in step 1 are properly configured.

By following these steps, you ensure that your ARMv8-A system operates in AArch32 mode at runtime. Keep in mind that, depending on your use case, certain performance and features available in AArch64 mode might not be accessible when operating in AArch32 mode.

**You:**

Is uboot 32-bit or 64-bit?

**ChatGPT:**

U-Boot, or the Universal Bootloader, is a widely used open-source bootloader that can be built for various target platforms and architectures. It can be built for both 32-bit and 64-bit ARM architectures depending on the target system and its requirements.

When building U-Boot for a specific ARM platform, you can configure it to support either 32-bit (AArch32) or 64-bit (AArch64) execution states, depending on the underlying hardware and your requirements. If your target system is based on ARMv8-A or a newer architecture, you may choose to build U-Boot in 64-bit mode to take advantage of the features and performance improvements offered by the AArch64 execution state.

In summary, U-Boot can be built as either 32-bit or 64-bit, depending on the target platform and requirements. The specific execution state depends on the build configuration and the target hardware capabilities.
