Attestation
    q: What is attestation?
    q: Is secure boot of an attestation?
    q: Which type of attestation is secure boot?
    q: What are types of attestation?
    q: Are remote or local attestations hardware or software?
    q: Please build a cross table. The x axis is hardwared-based and software-based, The y axis is Remote and Local. Please contain Intel SGX, TPM, TLS, SSH, digital signatures, secure boot

MRENCLAVE
    q: What is MRENCLAVE?
    from: Papers.SGX.0419.md

    q: Who generates MRENCLAVE?
    from: Papers.SGX.0419.md

    q: Who creates an enclave?
    from: Papers.SGX.0419.md

    q: So an untrusted software can also create an enclave. Right?
    from: Papers.SGX.0419.md

    q: I have enclave A and enclave B. How does enclave A know the enclave B before A wants to get MRENCLAVE value of B?
    from: Papers.SGX.0419.md

EGETKEY
    q: What is enclave software?
    q: Is the EGETKEY instruction only called by enclave software?
    q: Can I get hardware-protected key by calling EGETKEY instruction in enclave software?
    q: So after I get the hardware-protected key, I can print it. Is it safe?

MRSIGNER
    q: What does MRSIGNER contain? Please list them?
    from: Papers.SGX.0419.md

    q: What is enclave identity?
    q: How to generate MRSIGNER?
    q: Is MRSIGNER only one?
    q: Where to save the private key generated in the process of generating MRSIGNER?

    q: Who can write MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER?
    from: Papers.SGX.0419.md

    q: Only hardware can write the both registers. Right?
    from: Papers.SGX.0419.md

    from: Papers.SGX.0419.md   

EPID:
    q: What is EPID?
    q: How does EPID work?
    q: Which problems does EPID solve?
    q: How do I make sure that the EPID issuer doesn't retain private keys?
    q: How does EPID revoke a compromised device?
