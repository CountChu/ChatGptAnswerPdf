Basic Concepts
    q: https://github.com/OP-TEE
    q: What is OP-TEE?
    q: What is thre prefix OP of OP-TEE?
    q: Are there alternative technologies of OP-TEE?
    q: Does OP-TEE a software or a hardware solution?
    q: Is OP-TEE a firmware?
    q: Does OP-TEE only exist in secure world?
    q: Are there successfull cases of OP-TEE?
    q: What are different between ARM OP-TEE and Intel SMM? Please also summarize in a table.

Boot
    q: Does OP-TEE OS exist in a single core or multiple cores at run-time?
    q: Why does OP-TEE's reset function have two branches reset_primary and reset_secondary?
    q: Why does OP-TEE initialize secondary cores when reset?

Multi-Thread & Multi-Process
    q: Can secure kernel and trusted applications in OP-TEE can be multi-thread?
    q: What is secure context switching in TrustZone?
    q: Does OP-TEE support multi-process?
    q: Does OP-TEE support IPC?

Memory
    q: Does OP-TEE support shared memory?
    q: Can secure world can access memory in normal world?
    q: Can normal world access memory in secure world?
    q: How does OP-TEE manage memory?
    q: Are data in memory in secure world encrypted?
    q: What is SMAF?
    q: What is CMA?

Network
    q: Does OP-TEE support network communication in secure world?

Signature
    q: Is signature required when a normal world application request a service in secure world?
    q: Does OP-TEE support to verify a signature of a TA in X.509 certificate?

Development
    q: Which languages do I use to develop apps in OP-TEE or to customize OP-TEE?
    q: Can I use other langauges?
    q: Does OP-TEE support ARMv7 and ARMv8?
    q: Does OP-TEE have a shell?
    q: Can I create a TA at run-time?
    q: But what is TEECI_LoadSecureModule()
    q: What are Static TA and Dynamic TA? Please also summarize them in a table.
    q: Does TEE define Static TA and Dynamic TA?
    q: How to recover a crashed static TA?
    q: How to recover a crashed dynamic TA?

Qualcomm 
    q: Does Qualcomm support OP-TEE?
    q: Is QTEE open source?

DRM
    q: How do I implement DRM of content decryption with OP-TEE?
    q: So the content is decrypted in TA in secure world. Right?
    q: But does it slow down the playback speed because of switching between normal world and secure world?
    q: Can I use multi cores to solve the problem? For example, one core decrypts content and another core play content at the same time.
    q: Does OP-TEE support TUI?
    q: Can I develop a TA with TUI to play video in OP-TEE?
    q: How do I implement a DRM solution using ClearKey in OP-TEE?

Secure Storage
    q: Does OP-TEE support file system?
    q: How does OP-TEE generate SSK from HUK in tee_fs_init_key_manager()?
    q: In the function, can I read the content of the HUK?
    q: How do I protect HUK from reading in OP-TEE?
    q: Is SSK defined in GlobalPlatform?

Recover OP-TEE
    q: How to detect OP-TEE dead?
    q: How to automatically recovery the crashed OP-TEE?
    q: Can I develop a dual OP-TEE so that if one is crashed, run another.
    q: How to detect if OP-TEE is tamperred at run-time?

Attack
    q: Whare are kinds of methods to attack OP-TEE?

Virtualization
    q-prefix: The following article are from the website https://optee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/virtualization.html
    q: Does the hypervisor relied on OP-TEE run in normal world or secure world?
    q: Does OP-TEE support VMs?
    q: Is the technology of OP-TEE supporting VMs mature?
    q: Does a TA run in a VM described in the article?
