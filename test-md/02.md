Certainly! The concept of factorized second moment estimation arises from the need to reduce memory requirements in certain optimizers, particularly for large models. To demonstrate this with a simplified example, let's consider a matrix of gradients, as you'd find in fully connected layers of neural networks.

Imagine we have a 2x2 gradient matrix \( G \) from a single training iteration:

\[
G =
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 4 \\
1 & 3 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

If you were to compute the full second moment matrix, you would square each of these gradients:

\[
G^2 =
\begin{bmatrix}
4 & 16 \\
1 & 9 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Now, instead of storing this entire squared matrix, Adafactor uses factorization to break it down.

One factorized approach is to take row-wise and column-wise mean of the squared values. For our 2x2 matrix, this would look like:

Row-wise mean:

- Mean of row 1: \( \frac{4 + 16}{2} = 10 \)
- Mean of row 2: \( \frac{1 + 9}{2} = 5 \)

Column-wise mean:

- Mean of column 1: \( \frac{4 + 1}{2} = 2.5 \)
- Mean of column 2: \( \frac{16 + 9}{2} = 12.5 \)

You can see that instead of storing four values (from \( G^2 \)), we're storing just four means. The reduction in memory is more apparent for larger matrices. These mean values can then be used to approximate the original squared gradient matrix, and guide the optimization process.

The actual factorization technique in Adafactor is a bit more involved, especially for larger matrices, but the basic idea is to represent the full matrix with fewer values, capturing the primary variances without maintaining the full squared gradient matrix. This makes it memory-efficient, especially for models with large numbers of parameters.
