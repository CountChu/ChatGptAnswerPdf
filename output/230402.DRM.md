# Q & A
## Basic Concept
**Question:** What is DRM?

**Answer:**

DRM stands for Digital Rights Management. It is a set of technologies and techniques used by copyright holders, publishers, and content providers to control the access, distribution, and usage of digital media, such as software, ebooks, music, and movies. The primary goal of DRM is to protect intellectual property rights and prevent unauthorized copying, sharing, or modification of digital content.

DRM systems typically involve encryption, digital watermarks, or other mechanisms that restrict the use of content to authorized users or devices. Common DRM methods include requiring a user to enter a license key, limiting the number of devices on which content can be accessed, or implementing online authentication checks.

While DRM is intended to combat piracy and protect creators' rights, it has also been criticized for potentially infringing on consumer rights, hindering fair use, and causing inconvenience for legitimate users.

**Question:** How does DRM protect digital contents?

**Answer:**

DRM protects digital content by implementing various access control measures and restrictions that prevent unauthorized copying, distribution, and usage. Here are some common methods used by DRM systems to protect digital content:

1.  Encryption: DRM systems can encrypt content, which means the data is scrambled and can only be decrypted and accessed by authorized users or devices with the correct decryption key. This prevents unauthorized users from accessing the content.

2.  Authentication: DRM systems may require users to authenticate their identity or ownership of the content, often through online servers. This could involve entering a unique license key, providing login credentials, or validating a purchase receipt.

3.  Device Binding: DRM can restrict the number of devices on which content can be accessed or installed. This prevents users from sharing content with an unlimited number of devices, which could lead to piracy.

4.  Time Limitations: Some DRM systems limit the duration for which content can be accessed, requiring users to renew their licenses periodically. This can be used for subscription-based services or time-limited trials.

5.  Digital Watermarking: Digital watermarks are embedded into the content and can be used to trace unauthorized copies back to the original user. This discourages illegal sharing as it can lead to the identification of the source.

6.  Copy Protection: DRM can restrict the ability to copy or duplicate the content. This can be achieved through various techniques, such as copy-protected CDs or the inability to use screen capture tools on protected video content.

7.  Usage Restrictions: DRM can impose limitations on how content is used, such as preventing printing, editing, or sharing of ebooks or documents.


These methods work together to ensure that only authorized users can access and use the digital content while minimizing the potential for piracy or unauthorized sharing. However, DRM has also faced criticism for sometimes being overly restrictive, causing inconvenience to legitimate users, and limiting the fair use of content.

**Question:** Please describe more detail about encryption method.

**Answer:**

Encryption is a key method used in DRM systems to protect digital content by converting the original data into a scrambled, unreadable format that can only be accessed by authorized users or devices with the correct decryption key. Here's a more detailed look at the encryption process in DRM:

1.  Symmetric Key Encryption: In symmetric key encryption, a single secret key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the content. The content provider encrypts the data using this secret key, and the authorized user or device must use the same key to decrypt the content. The main challenge with symmetric key encryption is securely distributing the secret key to authorized users without it falling into the hands of unauthorized users.

2.  Asymmetric Key Encryption: Asymmetric key encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, uses two separate keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt the data, while the private key is used to decrypt it. The content provider encrypts the data using the public key of the authorized user, and only the corresponding private key can decrypt the content. The private key is never shared and must be securely stored by the user or device. This method resolves the key distribution issue of symmetric key encryption but can be more computationally intensive.

3.  Hybrid Encryption: Hybrid encryption combines the advantages of both symmetric and asymmetric key encryption. In this approach, a symmetric key is generated for encrypting the content, and then the symmetric key itself is encrypted using the public key of the authorized user. This combines the computational efficiency of symmetric key encryption with the secure key distribution of asymmetric key encryption.


In a DRM system, the encrypted content is typically packaged with metadata that includes information about the content, usage rights, and restrictions. When an authorized user or device attempts to access the content, the DRM system verifies their credentials or license and provides the necessary decryption key or mechanism to unlock the content. The content remains encrypted during transmission and storage, which makes it difficult for unauthorized users to access or tamper with the data.

It's important to note that while encryption is a powerful tool for protecting digital content, it is not foolproof. Skilled hackers or attackers may still find ways to circumvent encryption, and there is an ongoing arms race between DRM technologies and methods used to bypass them.

**Question:** Please explain Time Limitations used by DRM.

**Answer:**

Time limitations are a method used by some DRM systems to control access to digital content for a specific period. By imposing a time constraint, content providers can offer temporary access to the content, such as rentals, trials, or subscription-based services. Here's how time limitations work in DRM:

1.  Time-based Licenses: When a user purchases or acquires access to digital content, the DRM system issues a license that specifies the duration of access. The license contains information about the start and end dates, as well as any usage rights and restrictions associated with the content. The DRM system ensures that the content is only accessible during the specified period, after which the license expires, and the user can no longer access the content without renewing or obtaining a new license.

2.  Subscription-based Services: Time limitations are often used in subscription-based services, such as streaming platforms or software as a service (SaaS). Users pay a recurring fee to access the content or services for a specific period (e.g., monthly or annually). The DRM system continually checks the user's subscription status and grants access to the content as long as the subscription is active. Once the subscription expires, access to the content is revoked until the user renews their subscription.

3.  Time-limited Trials: Time limitations can also be used for offering trial versions of digital content, such as software, games, or premium features. The user is granted access to the content for a limited time (e.g., 7 days, 14 days, or 30 days), allowing them to evaluate the product before deciding whether to purchase or subscribe. After the trial period ends, the DRM system blocks access to the content, and the user must obtain a full license or subscription to continue using it.

4.  Rentals: In the case of digital media rentals, such as movies or e-books, time limitations enable users to access the content for a short period (e.g., 24 hours, 48 hours, or a week) at a lower cost compared to purchasing the content outright. Once the rental period expires, the DRM system prevents further access to the content.


Time limitations used by DRM systems ensure that access to digital content is granted only for the agreed-upon duration, allowing content providers to monetize their products and services through various pricing models and usage scenarios. However, time limitations can also be a point of criticism, as they may limit the user's ability to use the content freely and may require continuous internet connectivity for the DRM system to verify the validity of the license or subscription.

**Question:** What is ClearKey?

**Answer:**

ClearKey is a simple, non-proprietary DRM system that is part of the Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) specification for HTML5. EME is a framework that allows web browsers to interact with DRM systems, enabling the playback of encrypted media content within web pages without the need for plugins like Adobe Flash or Microsoft Silverlight.

ClearKey is designed to be a lightweight, easy-to-implement DRM solution that uses clear-text key exchange for content decryption. It provides a basic level of content protection without the complexity and cost associated with more advanced DRM systems like Google's Widevine, Apple's FairPlay, or Microsoft's PlayReady.

In ClearKey, the content is encrypted using a key, and the encrypted content is then transmitted to the user's device. The decryption key is sent separately, typically in clear text, meaning it is not further encrypted or obfuscated. The user's device, usually a web browser supporting EME, uses the ClearKey decryption key to unlock and play the content.

While ClearKey provides a basic level of protection, its simplicity and the use of clear-text key exchange make it less secure than other DRM solutions. As a result, ClearKey is not recommended for high-value content or scenarios that require robust protection against piracy or unauthorized access. It is more suited for low-risk applications or as a fallback option when other DRM systems are not available or supported by the user's device.
