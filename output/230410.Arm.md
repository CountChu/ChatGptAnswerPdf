# Q & A
## Basic Concept
**Question:** What are types of ARM CPU? Please also describe them in a table.

**Answer:**

ARM CPUs come in a variety of architectures and designs, each tailored to specific needs and applications. Some common types of ARM CPUs are Cortex-A, Cortex-R, and Cortex-M series. Here's a table describing these three series:

| Series | Target Applications | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cortex-A | High-performance systems | Designed for high-performance devices like smartphones, tablets, and other consumer electronics, as well as servers. These processors provide high performance and power efficiency, suitable for running complex operating systems like Linux, Android, and iOS. Typical examples include Cortex-A72, Cortex-A75, and Cortex-A76. |
| Cortex-R | Real-time systems | Targeted towards real-time systems that require fast, deterministic response times like automotive electronics, industrial control systems, and medical devices. These processors prioritize reliability, fault tolerance, and real-time performance. Examples include Cortex-R4, Cortex-R5, and Cortex-R8. |
| Cortex-M | Low-power microcontrollers | Optimized for low-power, cost-sensitive applications like IoT devices, wearables, and other embedded systems. These processors are designed to offer low-latency response times, energy efficiency, and ease of use. Examples include Cortex-M0, Cortex-M3, Cortex-M4, and Cortex-M7. |

Please note that within each series, there are multiple specific processor models with different performance levels, features, and target applications. The examples provided above are not exhaustive.

**Question:** What is "Arm A-profile"?

**Answer:**

"Arm A-profile" refers to a specific family of Arm processors that are designed for high-performance and power-efficient applications. These processors are part of the Cortex-A series, which is well-suited for devices such as smartphones, tablets, and other consumer electronics, as well as servers and networking equipment.

A-profile processors are based on the Armv8-A architecture, which includes both 64-bit (AArch64) and 32-bit (AArch32) execution states. The Armv8-A architecture introduced several enhancements over the previous Armv7 architecture, such as improved performance, better energy efficiency, and increased security features.

Cortex-A processors are used in various systems running complex operating systems like Linux, Android, and iOS. They offer advanced features such as out-of-order execution, superscalar pipelines, and support for virtualization and memory management.

In summary, the term "Arm A-profile" refers to the Cortex-A series of Arm processors that are designed for high-performance and power-efficient applications in devices such as smartphones, tablets, and servers.

**Question:** Does "Arm Firmware Framework for Arm A-profile" document is only about Cortex-A?

**Answer:**

The "Arm Firmware Framework for Arm A-profile" document primarily focuses on the Cortex-A series processors, as they are the high-performance processors designed for running complex operating systems and applications. However, the document also encompasses other Arm A-profile processors based on the Armv8-A architecture.

While the document is primarily targeted at Cortex-A processors and their associated firmware, some concepts and features may be applicable to other Arm processor families as well, such as Cortex-R and Cortex-M. The Firmware Framework aims to provide a standardized software architecture for security, isolation, and communication between software components running on Arm A-profile processors.
