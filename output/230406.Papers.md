# Q & A
## 2017 vTZ
**Question:** Paper: vTZ: Virtualizing ARM TrustZone

**Answer:**

Paper Summary:

The paper titled "vTZ: Virtualizing ARM TrustZone" addresses the challenge of virtualizing ARM TrustZone, which is not designed to be virtualizable, in order to securely share it among multiple virtual machines (VMs). ARM TrustZone is a security extension providing a secure world or trusted execution environment (TEE) for running security-sensitive code, primarily in mobile platforms. As ARM64 becomes more popular in server markets like cloud, TrustZone is expected to become a key component of cloud security.

The authors present vTZ, a solution that allows each guest VM to have a virtualized guest TEE using existing hardware. vTZ separates functionality from protection by maintaining a secure co-running VM to serve as a guest TEE, while utilizing hardware TrustZone for strong isolation among guest TEEs and the untrusted hypervisor. vTZ employs a tiny monitor within the physical TrustZone that securely interposes and virtualizes memory mapping and world switching. Additionally, it uses a Constrained Isolated Execution Environment (CIEE) with protected, self-contained code to ensure secure virtualization and isolation among multiple guest TEEs.

The authors implemented vTZ on Xen 4.8 on both ARMv7 and ARMv8 development boards and evaluated its performance using two common TEE-kernels, seL4 1 and OP-TEE. The results demonstrated that vTZ provides robust security with minimal performance overhead.

## 2020 HETEE
**Question:** Title: Enabling Rack-scale Confidential Computing using Heterogeneous Trusted Execution Environment

**Answer:**

Paper Summary:

The paper titled "Enabling Rack-scale Confidential Computing using Heterogeneous Trusted Execution Environment" addresses the limitations of today's Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) in supporting large-scale confidential computing involving high-throughput accelerators like GPUs, FPGAs, and TPUs. Existing solutions that extend CPU-like enclaves to GPUs require chip-level changes, may introduce new security risks due to side-channel leaks, and are constrained by CPU TEE resources.

The authors present HETEE, a novel Heterogeneous TEE design that supports large-scale compute or data-intensive (CDI) computing without requiring chip-level changes. HETEE is a device for centralized management of all computing units (e.g., GPUs and other accelerators) in a server rack. It works with today's data centers and clouds, leveraging resource pooling technologies to dynamically compartmentalize computing tasks, enforce strong isolation, and reduce Trusted Computing Base (TCB) through hardware support.

HETEE uses PCIe ExpressFabric to allocate accelerators to server nodes for non-sensitive CDI tasks and moves them back into a secure enclave when confidential computing is required. A thin TCB stack for security management runs on a security controller (SC), while other software components run on integrated microservers that operate enclaves. Enclaves are physically isolated through hardware and verified by the SC at their inception, with microservers and computing units restored to a secure state upon termination.

The authors implemented HETEE on a real hardware system and evaluated its performance using popular neural network inference and training tasks. The evaluation results show that HETEE can easily support real-world scale CDI tasks, with a maximum throughput overhead of 2.17% for inference and 0.95% for training on ResNet152.

TEEs, which are used to protect security-critical applications and OS components, are often assumed to be highly secure. However, various successful attacks on TEEs have been reported in recent years, revealing security flaws in TEE systems.

The authors conduct a security analysis of popular TrustZone-assisted TEE systems, targeting Cortex-A processors, developed by Qualcomm, Trustonic, Huawei, Nvidia, and Linaro. They study publicly documented exploits and vulnerabilities and reverse-engineer the TEE firmware to identify critical vulnerabilities across existing systems. The findings raise legitimate concerns about the security of commercial TEE implementations.

This paper provides valuable insights into the types of vulnerabilities that affect TrustZone-assisted TEE systems and highlights the need for robust security measures to protect TEEs from potential attacks. The research contributes to a better understanding of TEE security and helps inform future improvements in TEE design and implementation.

## 2020 RusTEE
**Question:** Title: RusTEE: Developing Memory-Safe ARMTrustZone Applications

**Answer:**

Paper Summary:

The paper titled "RusTEE: Developing Memory-Safe ARM TrustZone Applications" addresses the issue of vulnerabilities in trusted applications running in ARM TrustZone's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). While TrustZone provides isolation to protect trusted applications from malicious software in the untrusted rich execution environment (REE), it cannot prevent vulnerabilities within trusted applications themselves. Many trusted applications are written in memory-unsafe languages like C, leading to reported memory corruption vulnerabilities.

The authors propose RusTEE, a trusted application mechanism that uses Rust, a memory-safe programming language, to enhance the security of trusted applications. They address several challenges in adopting Rust for mobile TEEs, as Rust does not currently support TrustZone-assisted TEE systems. The paper presents the following contributions:

1.  Extending the Rust compiler: The authors extend the existing Rust compiler to provide support for TrustZone-assisted TEE systems.
2.  Implementing comprehensive security mechanisms: They resolve two security issues of trusted applications, namely, securely invoking high-privileged system services and securely communicating with untrusted REE.
3.  Developing a prototype: The authors implement a prototype of RusTEE as an SDK for trusted applications, supporting both emulators and real hardware devices.

Experimental results show that RusTEE can compile applications with close-to-C performance on the evaluated platforms, demonstrating the potential of using Rust to enhance the security of trusted applications in ARM TrustZone TEE systems.

## 2020 Bao
**Question:** Paper: Bao: A Lightweight Static Partitioning Hypervisor for Modern Multi-Core Embedded Systems

**Answer:**

Paper Summary:

The paper titled "Bao: A Lightweight Static Partitioning Hypervisor for Modern Multi-Core Embedded Systems" addresses the need for a virtualization solution in increasingly complex and mixed-criticality modern embedded systems. Current hypervisors like KVM and Xen were not designed for embedded constraints and requirements. The static partitioning architecture used by Jailhouse seems to address embedded concerns, but it still relies on Linux to boot and manage its virtual machines (VMs).

The authors present Bao, a minimal, standalone, and clean-slate implementation of the static partitioning architecture for Armv8 and RISC-V platforms. Bao is a lightweight hypervisor designed specifically for modern multi-core embedded systems, offering strong spatial and temporal isolation. The main contributions of the paper include:

1.  A minimal, standalone implementation: Bao is a clean-slate implementation of the static partitioning architecture, removing the dependency on Linux for booting and managing VMs.
2.  Support for Armv8 and RISC-V platforms: Bao is designed to work with both Armv8 and RISC-V platforms, making it suitable for a wide range of embedded systems.
3.  Low virtualization overhead: Preliminary results regarding size, boot, performance, and interrupt latency demonstrate that Bao incurs minimal virtualization overhead.

The authors plan to make Bao publicly available, aiming to engage both industry and academia in improving Bao's safety, security, and real-time guarantees. This paper presents a novel approach to virtualization in embedded systems, addressing the unique constraints and requirements of these systems while minimizing overhead.

**Question:** What is static partitioning?

**Answer:**

Static partitioning is a method of resource allocation in which system resources, such as memory, CPU time, and I/O devices, are divided into fixed, non-overlapping partitions. Each partition is assigned to a specific application, task, or virtual machine. The allocation of resources is determined at design time or during system initialization, and it remains fixed during the runtime of the system.

Static partitioning is often used in real-time and safety-critical systems, where strong spatial and temporal isolation between tasks is required to ensure predictable system behavior and to prevent interference between tasks. This isolation helps in maintaining the performance, safety, and security of the system.

In the context of hypervisors, static partitioning refers to creating fixed, isolated partitions for virtual machines (VMs) or operating system instances. Each partition is allocated a fixed set of resources, such as CPU cores, memory, and I/O devices. This approach contrasts with dynamic partitioning, where resource allocation can be adjusted during runtime based on the changing needs of the system. Static partitioning in hypervisors can help achieve better isolation, predictability, and reduced overhead compared to dynamic partitioning.

**Question:** Is Bao a hypervisor?

**Answer:**

Yes, Bao is a hypervisor. Specifically, it is a lightweight static partitioning hypervisor designed for modern multi-core embedded systems. The Bao hypervisor provides a minimal, standalone, and clean-slate implementation of the static partitioning architecture for Armv8 and RISC-V platforms. Its main goal is to achieve strong spatial and temporal isolation with minimal virtualization overhead in embedded systems.

## 2019 Research on TrustZone
**Question:** Paper: Research on ARM TrustZone

**Answer:**

Paper Summary:

The paper titled "Research on ARM TrustZone" discusses ARM TrustZone, a hardware-based security feature providing a high-privilege and isolated execution environment known as the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). TrustZone technology was proposed in 2002, but it gained widespread adoption in 2009 when Apple used it to protect Touch ID in the iPhone 5s. TrustZone ensures that user fingerprint data remains secure even if the iOS is compromised.

In 2017, Google mandated TEE for all Android devices with a fingerprint scanner. Today, almost all mobile phones and tablets have TEE deployed. ARM has integrated TrustZone into ARM64 and ARMv8-M to support a broader range of platforms, including servers and IoT devices.

The paper provides valuable insights into the ARM TrustZone technology, discussing its importance in providing a secure and isolated execution environment. It highlights the adoption of TrustZone by major tech companies like Apple and Google and emphasizes its relevance in the growing field of servers and IoT devices.

---

**Question:** The below context comes from "Other Platforms: IoT, Drone, Cloud" of the paper "Research on ARM TrustZone"

**Answer:**

In this section, the authors discuss how ARM TrustZone technology is applied to different types of platforms, such as IoT devices, drones, and cloud computing. They provide examples of various projects and research that utilize TrustZone to improve the security of these platforms:

1.  Ditio: This project aims to enhance the security of IoT devices by recording sensor activity logs using TrustZone and virtualization support. Ditio captures access to sensor registers without modifying the Rich Execution Environment (REE) operating system. This generates a complete log of sensor activities that can be audited and checked for compliance with specific policies. Ditio also offers a tool for easier log analysis.

2.  PROTC: This project utilizes TrustZone on drone platforms to protect peripherals. PROTC deploys a monitor in the secure world to enforce a secure access control policy for some peripherals on the drone, ensuring that only authorized applications can access specific peripherals.

3.  vTZ: This research addresses the limitation of TrustZone, which can only provide one secure world, meaning multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a server must share the single secure world. vTZ virtualizes TrustZone to offer each VM an isolated secure world. With vTZ, software in a VM can use the Secure Monitor Call (SMC) instruction to switch between the REE and a virtual TEE. This preserves all TrustZone features after virtualization. The implementation requires an REE hypervisor but does not need to trust it.


These examples showcase the versatility of TrustZone technology and its potential for improving security on various platforms beyond mobile phones.

---

**Question:** In the context, vTZ run in normal world. Why does not vTZ run in normal world need to trust REE hypervisor?

**Answer:**

vTZ is designed to virtualize ARM TrustZone to offer each virtual machine (VM) an isolated secure world. Although vTZ runs in the normal world, it does not need to trust the REE hypervisor because of the hardware-level isolation provided by ARM TrustZone.

TrustZone ensures a strong isolation between the secure world (trusted execution environment) and the normal world (rich execution environment). When vTZ is implemented, it leverages the security features provided by TrustZone to maintain a separation between the virtual TEEs and the REE hypervisor.

As a result, even though vTZ operates in the normal world and interacts with the REE hypervisor, the secure world components (virtual TEEs) remain protected from potential attacks or vulnerabilities in the REE hypervisor. This isolation allows vTZ to run securely without having to trust the REE hypervisor.

## 2019 TEEv
**Question:** Paper: TEEv: Virtualizing Trusted Execution Environmentson Mobile Platforms

**Answer:**

Paper Summary:

The paper titled "TEEv: Virtualizing Trusted Execution Environments on Mobile Platforms" discusses the challenges of transitioning from vendor-controlled, single-purpose Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to open TEEs that host Trusted Applications (TAs) from multiple sources with independent tasks. This transition can lead to an enlarged attack surface and a lack of trust or isolation among TAs and the TEE.

To address these challenges, the authors propose TEEv, a TEE virtualization architecture that supports multiple isolated, restricted TEE instances (vTEEs) running concurrently. TEEv relies on a tiny hypervisor called TEE-visor, allowing TEE instances from different vendors to run in isolation on the same smartphone and host their own TAs. This ensures that a compromised vTEE cannot affect its peers or the Rich Execution Environment (REE), and TAs no longer have to run in untrusted or unsuitable TEEs.

The paper presents an implementation of TEEv on a development board and a real smartphone, running multiple commercial TEE instances from different vendors with minimal porting effort. The evaluation results show that TEEv can isolate vTEEs and defend against all known attacks on TEE with only mild performance overhead.

---

**Question:** Please compare TEEv and vTZ and also summarize them in a table.

**Answer:**

TEEv and vTZ are two different approaches to virtualize Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) on mobile platforms. Here is a comparison and summary of both in the form of a table:

| Aspect | TEEv | vTZ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Objective | Virtualize TEEs to support multiple isolated, restricted TEE instances | Virtualize TrustZone to offer each VM an isolated secure world |
| Architecture | Relying on a tiny hypervisor (TEE-visor) | Requires an REE hypervisor but does not need to trust it |
| Implementation | Runs multiple commercial TEE instances from different vendors | Uses SMC instruction to switch between REE and a virtual TEE |
| Security | Isolates vTEEs and defends against known attacks on TEE | Preserves all TrustZone features after virtualization |
| Performance | Mild performance overhead | Not explicitly mentioned |

TEEv is a TEE virtualization architecture that supports multiple isolated, restricted TEE instances (vTEEs) running concurrently. It relies on a tiny hypervisor called the TEE-visor, allowing TEE instances from different vendors to run in isolation on the same smartphone and host their own Trusted Applications (TAs). TEEv can isolate vTEEs and defend against all known attacks on TEEs with only mild performance overhead.

vTZ aims to virtualize TrustZone to provide each VM an isolated secure world. This approach requires an REE hypervisor but does not need to trust it, as the hardware-level isolation provided by TrustZone is leveraged to maintain separation between the virtual TEEs and the REE hypervisor. With vTZ, software in a VM can use the SMC instruction to switch between the REE and a virtual TEE, just as it does in a non-virtualized environment, preserving all the features of TrustZone after virtualization.

## Hypervisor
**Question:** Please compare hypervisor and virtualization and also summarize them in a table.

**Answer:**

Hypervisor and virtualization are related concepts but serve different purposes. Here's a comparison and summary of both in a table:

| Aspect | Hypervisor | Virtualization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Definition | A software layer or firmware that manages and controls virtual machines (VMs). | The process of creating multiple isolated virtual environments on a single physical hardware. |
| Purpose | Allows multiple VMs to run concurrently on a single hardware platform. | To efficiently utilize hardware resources, improve flexibility, and increase security by isolating workloads. |
| Types | 1\. Type 1 (Bare-metal): Runs directly on hardware. Examples: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen, and KVM. <br> 2. Type 2 (Hosted): Runs as a software layer on top of an existing operating system (OS). Examples: VMware Workstation, VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop. | 1\. Full Virtualization: VMs have no direct access to the hardware and are managed by a hypervisor. <br> 2. Paravirtualization: VMs are aware of the hypervisor and can make calls to the hypervisor for better performance. <br> 3. OS-level Virtualization: Creates isolated instances (containers) within a single OS kernel, sharing the same OS but having their own file systems and process spaces. Examples: Docker and LXC. |
| Functionality | Allocates resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and network to VMs, and manages their life cycle. | Separates applications, OSs, and hardware resources, enabling multiple workloads to run simultaneously on a single physical host. |
| Performance Impact | Hypervisors may introduce some overhead due to resource management and virtual-to-physical resource mapping. | Virtualization may cause a performance impact, depending on the type and extent of virtualization used. However, paravirtualization and OS-level virtualization generally have lower overhead compared to full virtualization. |

In summary, a hypervisor is a software layer or firmware that enables and manages virtualization. Virtualization, on the other hand, is the process of creating isolated virtual environments on a single physical hardware platform, allowing for more efficient resource utilization, flexibility, and increased security.

**Question:** Is TrustZone a hypervisor or virtualization?

**Answer:**

TrustZone is neither a hypervisor nor virtualization. TrustZone is a hardware-based security technology developed by ARM. It provides an isolated and secure environment called the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for running sensitive and security-critical applications, alongside the Rich Execution Environment (REE) where the main operating system and applications run.

TrustZone creates two separate worlds - the secure world and the normal world - by partitioning the hardware resources such as processor, memory, and peripherals. The secure world is designed to protect sensitive data and operations, while the normal world runs the typical operating system and applications. The two worlds are isolated at the hardware level, ensuring that security vulnerabilities in the normal world do not compromise the secure world.

In summary, TrustZone is a security feature designed to provide hardware-level isolation for sensitive operations and data, rather than a hypervisor or virtualization technology.

---

**Question:** Is OP-TEE a hypervisor or virtualization?

**Answer:**

OP-TEE (Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment) is neither a hypervisor nor virtualization. It is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) designed to work with ARM TrustZone technology. OP-TEE is an open-source software solution that provides a secure environment for running security-critical applications.

When used in conjunction with TrustZone, OP-TEE provides the secure operating system and services that run within the secure world created by TrustZone. It manages access to secure resources and protects sensitive data and operations from unauthorized access in the normal world.

In summary, OP-TEE is a TEE solution that works with TrustZone to provide a secure environment for security-critical applications, rather than a hypervisor or virtualization technology.

---

**Question:** Does virtualization depend on hypervisor?

**Answer:**

Yes, virtualization typically depends on a hypervisor. A hypervisor is a critical component of virtualization technology, as it is responsible for creating, managing, and running virtual machines (VMs) on a physical host system. The hypervisor manages the distribution of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, among the various VMs and provides isolation between them.

There are two types of hypervisors:

1.  Type 1 (bare-metal) hypervisors: These hypervisors run directly on the host's hardware, without the need for a host operating system. Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.

2.  Type 2 (hosted) hypervisors: These hypervisors run on top of a host operating system and manage virtual machines within the host environment. Examples include Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, and Microsoft Virtual PC.


In both cases, the hypervisor is the key component that enables virtualization, providing the necessary management and isolation between virtual machines running on a single physical host.

---

**Question:** Does VM require hypervisor?

**Answer:**

Yes, virtual machines (VMs) typically require a hypervisor to function. A hypervisor is the essential component responsible for creating, managing, and running VMs on a physical host system. It allocates the physical resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, among the VMs and provides isolation between them. VMs are essentially software-based environments running on the hypervisor, which simulates the hardware and allows multiple VMs with different operating systems to share the same physical hardware resources.

There are alternative virtualization technologies, such as containerization (e.g., Docker), which do not rely on a hypervisor but instead use the host operating system's kernel to isolate and manage containers. However, in the context of traditional virtual machines, a hypervisor is a necessary component for their operation.

---

**Question:** What are types of virtualization techs?

**Answer:**

There are various types of virtualization technologies, each targeting a specific layer of computing or specific use cases. Here are some of the major types:

1.  Hardware or Platform Virtualization: This type of virtualization involves the creation of virtual machines (VMs) that share the physical hardware resources of a host system. Examples of hypervisors that enable this type of virtualization include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and KVM.

2.  Operating System Virtualization: This technology involves the creation of isolated environments, or containers, within a single host operating system. Each container shares the host OS's kernel but can have its own file system, libraries, and applications. Examples of containerization platforms include Docker, LXC, and Kubernetes.

3.  Application Virtualization: This technique enables running applications in isolated environments on a host system without needing to install them. Application virtualization ensures that the application's dependencies do not interfere with the host system or other applications. Examples include Microsoft App-V and VMware ThinApp.

4.  Network Virtualization: This type of virtualization abstracts the physical network infrastructure, allowing multiple virtual networks to share the same physical hardware. Network virtualization enables better utilization of resources, improved security, and easier network management. Examples include VMware NSX and Cisco ACI.

5.  Storage Virtualization: Storage virtualization abstracts the physical storage devices, allowing them to be pooled and managed centrally. This enables better resource utilization, improved performance, and easier management. Examples of storage virtualization technologies include software-defined storage (SDS) solutions, such as Ceph and VMware vSAN.

6.  Desktop Virtualization: This technology enables the delivery of a virtual desktop environment to users over a network. It separates the user's desktop environment from the physical hardware, allowing for centralized management, better resource utilization, and improved security. Examples of desktop virtualization solutions include VMware Horizon and Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops.


These are just a few examples of virtualization technologies, and many more specific solutions and implementations exist in the industry.

---

**Question:** Is hypvervisor a virtual machine manager?

**Answer:**

Yes, a hypervisor is often referred to as a virtual machine manager (VMM). A hypervisor is a software or firmware that manages the creation, execution, and management of virtual machines (VMs) on a host system. It allows multiple VMs to run concurrently on the same physical hardware, while providing isolation and resource management between them.

Hypervisors are responsible for abstracting the physical hardware resources and allocating them to the VMs, handling the VMs' requests for resources, and ensuring that the VMs do not interfere with each other or the host system. They play a crucial role in the virtualization process, making it possible to create and manage VMs efficiently and securely.

---

**Question:** Are there alnatives of hypervisor?

**Answer:**

Yes, there are alternatives to hypervisors for creating isolated environments. Some of these alternatives include:

1.  Containers: Containers are a lightweight form of virtualization that enables the running of multiple isolated applications on the same host without the need for a full-fledged hypervisor. Containers share the host's kernel and can run directly on the host's operating system, leading to less overhead compared to hypervisors. Examples of container technologies include Docker, LXC, and Kubernetes.

2.  Paravirtualization: Paravirtualization is an approach to virtualization where the guest operating system is modified to be aware of the virtualized environment and communicates directly with the host's hardware through a thin layer called the paravirtualization interface. This approach can offer better performance than full virtualization, but it requires modifying the guest operating system, which may not always be feasible. Xen is an example of a paravirtualization platform.

3.  Application-level virtualization: Application-level virtualization isolates individual applications rather than entire operating systems, allowing them to run in a sandboxed environment. This can provide isolation and security benefits without the overhead of full-system virtualization. Examples of application-level virtualization include Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which runs Java applications in a sandboxed environment, and Microsoft's .NET runtime.

4.  OS-level virtualization: OS-level virtualization provides isolated environments by partitioning a single operating system into multiple isolated instances called zones, jails, or namespaces. Each instance has its own file system, network stack, and process space, but they all share the same kernel. Examples of OS-level virtualization technologies include Solaris Zones, FreeBSD Jails, and Linux namespaces.


These alternatives each have their own advantages and trade-offs, and their suitability depends on the specific use case and requirements of the system being virtualized.

---

**Question:** Can a VM contain VMs?

**Answer:**

Yes, a virtual machine (VM) can contain other VMs, a concept known as nested virtualization. In nested virtualization, a hypervisor runs inside a virtual machine created by another hypervisor. This creates a hierarchy of virtual machines, where the primary hypervisor manages the first-level virtual machines, and the nested hypervisors manage the second-level virtual machines.

Nested virtualization can be useful in various scenarios, such as:

1.  Testing and development: Nested virtualization allows developers to test and experiment with different hypervisors and configurations without needing multiple physical machines.
2.  Training: Nested virtualization can be used for educational purposes, providing hands-on experience with different virtualization technologies.
3.  Cloud environments: Nested virtualization can help cloud providers support customers who want to use their own hypervisors on top of the cloud provider's infrastructure.

However, nested virtualization can also introduce additional overhead and complexity, which can negatively impact the performance of the nested VMs. Additionally, not all hypervisors support nested virtualization, and hardware virtualization support may be required for acceptable performance.

## 2020 Demystifying TEE Client API
**Question:** Paper: Demystifying ARM TrustZone TEE Client API using OP-TEE

**Answer:**

Title: Demystifying ARM TrustZone TEE Client API using OP-TEE

Abstract: With the increased use of mobile devices for various purposes, such as payment systems, the need for secure storage of critical data has become more important. Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology has emerged as a solution to provide a secure execution environment for sensitive data. ARM TrustZone technology, primarily used in mobile devices, divides a physical processor into the Normal World and Secure World, ensuring a safer execution environment. While various manufacturers have adopted TrustZone technology, existing commercial TEEs have limitations in conducting security research using TrustZone.

This paper introduces OP-TEE, an open-source project for implementing ARM TrustZone technology, and the TEE Client API that enables communication with Trusted Applications within the TrustZone Secure World. To demystify the TEE Client API, the authors also implemented a simple trusted application for communication between the Normal World and Secure World in the OP-TEE OS using the QEMU emulator. This research aims to make the TEE Client API more accessible and easier to understand for researchers and developers working with ARM TrustZone technology.
