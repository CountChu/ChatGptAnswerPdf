# Q & A
## History
**Question:** Please list history with years of TEE, TrustZone, and OP-TEE. Please also contain iPhone about TrustZone and Qualcomm about TEE. Please also contain ARM7 and ARM8. The history of OP-TEE must be detail.

**Answer:**

Here's a detailed history of TEE, TrustZone, and OP-TEE, along with information about the iPhone and Qualcomm in relation to TrustZone and TEE, as well as details on ARMv7 and ARMv8 architectures:

1.  Trusted Execution Environment (TEE): A TEE is a secure area within a device's processor that protects sensitive data and ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the data being processed. The concept of TEEs has been around since the early 2000s, but they have evolved significantly over the years.

2.  ARM TrustZone: TrustZone is a hardware-based security technology developed by ARM Holdings. It creates an isolated environment called a "secure world" within the processor, allowing for the secure execution of code and storage of sensitive data.


*   2004: ARM introduces TrustZone technology with the ARMv6 architecture.
*   2007: ARMv7 architecture is introduced, which also includes TrustZone support.
*   2011: ARMv8 architecture is introduced, continuing to support TrustZone technology.

3.  OP-TEE (Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment): OP-TEE is an open-source project that provides a TEE for ARM TrustZone-enabled platforms. It was initiated by STMicroelectronics in 2013 and is now maintained by Linaro, a collaborative engineering organization.

*   2013: OP-TEE project is initiated by STMicroelectronics.
*   2014: Linaro Security Working Group starts working on the OP-TEE project.
*   2015: Linaro takes over the maintenance and development of the OP-TEE project, providing releases, bug fixes, and ongoing support.

4.  iPhone and TrustZone: Apple, the company behind the iPhone, uses its custom ARM-based processors in its devices. Apple's processors, such as the A-series chips, implement ARM TrustZone technology to provide hardware-based security features.

*   2013: Apple introduces the Secure Enclave with the A7 chip, leveraging ARMv8 architecture and TrustZone technology.

5.  Qualcomm and TEE: Qualcomm, a leading semiconductor company, designs and manufactures ARM-based processors for mobile devices, such as its Snapdragon SoCs (System on a Chip). Qualcomm's processors implement TEEs to provide hardware-based security features.

*   2017: Qualcomm introduces the Secure Processing Unit (SPU), which uses ARMv8 architecture and functions as a TEE to protect sensitive user data and execute security-related tasks.

In conclusion, ARM's TrustZone technology has been an essential component of ARMv7 and ARMv8 architectures, providing hardware-based security for various devices. Major companies like Apple and Qualcomm have adopted TrustZone and TEE technologies in their products, while the open-source OP-TEE project further expands the capabilities of TrustZone-based secure environments.

**Question:** When did Qualcomm release QTEE?

**Answer:**

Qualcomm introduced the Qualcomm Trusted Execution Environment (QTEE) in 2011. QTEE is a secure area within a device's processor that provides hardware-based security features, leveraging ARM TrustZone technology. It is designed to protect sensitive data and execute security-related tasks on Qualcomm Snapdragon SoCs (System on a Chip).

**Question:** Please list history of Qualcomm TEE with years in detail.

**Answer:**

The history of Qualcomm's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) developments and implementations is closely tied to their Snapdragon SoC lineup. Here's a detailed timeline of Qualcomm's TEE milestones:

1.  2011: Qualcomm Trusted Execution Environment (QTEE) Introduction

*   Qualcomm introduces QTEE, a secure area within their Snapdragon SoCs, leveraging ARM TrustZone technology to protect sensitive data and execute security-related tasks.

2.  2017: Qualcomm Secure Processing Unit (SPU)

*   Qualcomm launches the Secure Processing Unit (SPU), a separate hardware component within Snapdragon SoCs. The SPU, which functions as a TEE, uses ARMv8 architecture and TrustZone technology to protect sensitive user data and execute security-related tasks.

These milestones showcase Qualcomm's ongoing efforts to improve the security features of their Snapdragon SoCs through the implementation of hardware-based TEEs, including QTEE and the Secure Processing Unit (SPU).

**Question:** Where do you find the year when Qualcomm introduced QTEE?

**Answer:**

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. After re-evaluating the information available, it seems that I was unable to find a specific year when Qualcomm introduced QTEE. It appears that I made an error in my previous response.

Qualcomm has been implementing Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) using ARM TrustZone technology in their Snapdragon SoCs for several years, but the exact year of introduction for QTEE is not readily available in public sources. Qualcomm's ongoing development of hardware-based security features includes the introduction of the Secure Processing Unit (SPU) in 2017.

## Qualcomm
**Question:** 2023/4/10: What is relationship between QTEE and SPU?

**Answer:**

The Qualcomm Trusted Execution Environment (QTEE) and the Secure Processing Unit (SPU) are both security solutions developed by Qualcomm for their Snapdragon SoCs (System on a Chip). Both QTEE and SPU leverage ARM TrustZone technology to create isolated secure environments within the processor, where sensitive data can be protected, and security-related tasks can be executed.

The relationship between QTEE and SPU can be summarized as follows:

1.  QTEE is an implementation of a Trusted Execution Environment within Qualcomm's Snapdragon SoCs. It provides a secure area within the processor to protect sensitive data and execute security-related tasks. QTEE relies on ARM TrustZone technology to create this secure environment.

2.  The Secure Processing Unit (SPU) is a separate hardware component introduced by Qualcomm in 2017. It is designed to enhance the security capabilities of Snapdragon SoCs. Like QTEE, the SPU also uses ARM TrustZone technology and functions as a Trusted Execution Environment. However, the SPU is a dedicated security subsystem separate from the main CPU, providing an additional layer of hardware-based security.


In summary, QTEE and SPU are both Qualcomm-developed security solutions for their Snapdragon SoCs, providing hardware-based security features using ARM TrustZone technology. While QTEE is an implementation of a TEE within the processor, the SPU is a separate hardware component that adds an extra layer of security.

**Question:** 2023/4/10: When was source code of QTEE opened?

**Answer:**

Qualcomm has not released the source code for their Trusted Execution Environment (QTEE) as it is a proprietary implementation of a Trusted Execution Environment within their Snapdragon SoCs. The source code for QTEE remains closed-source and is not available to the public.

In contrast, OP-TEE (Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment) is an open-source project providing a TEE for ARM TrustZone-enabled platforms. It was initiated by STMicroelectronics in 2013 and is now maintained by Linaro, a collaborative engineering organization. OP-TEE's source code is openly available on GitHub ([https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee\_os](https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os)).

---

**Question:** 2023/4/10: Does SPU rely on ARMv8?

**Answer:**

Qualcomm's Secure Processing Unit (SPU) is a hardware component introduced in 2017 within their Snapdragon SoCs. While the SPU functions as a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and leverages ARM TrustZone technology, it is not specifically dependent on ARMv8 architecture.

However, it is worth noting that many of Qualcomm's Snapdragon SoCs, including those that feature the SPU, do utilize the ARMv8 architecture. The ARMv8 architecture provides improved performance, energy efficiency, and security features, including support for TrustZone.

In summary, while the SPU does not exclusively rely on ARMv8, it is often used in conjunction with ARMv8-based Snapdragon SoCs to provide hardware-based security features.
