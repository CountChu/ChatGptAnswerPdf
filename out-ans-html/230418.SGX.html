<h2>Attestation</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is attestation? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Attestation is a security process that allows one entity to verify the authenticity, integrity, and trustworthiness of another entity, typically in the context of software or hardware systems. In the realm of computer security, attestation involves checking that a system or application is running as intended, without unauthorized modifications or tampering.</p>
<p>Attestation can occur between different entities, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Local attestation: This takes place between two entities on the same platform, such as two enclaves within the same system. They verify each other&rsquo;s trustworthiness before proceeding with a secure communication or data exchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remote attestation: This occurs when an entity on one platform attests its trustworthiness to another entity on a different platform, usually over a network. In this case, the verifier, which could be a service provider or another system, checks the trustworthiness of the prover, which is the platform running the enclave or secure application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Attestation often relies on cryptographic techniques, such as digital signatures, to ensure that the evidence provided during the attestation process is genuine and trustworthy. In the context of Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions), attestation involves verifying the authenticity and integrity of an enclave to ensure that the software running inside it is trusted and has not been tampered with.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is secure boot of an attestation? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, secure boot can be considered a form of attestation. Secure boot is a security feature implemented in many modern devices, such as computers, smartphones, and IoT devices, to ensure that the software being loaded during the boot process is genuine, trusted, and has not been tampered with.</p>
<p>When a device with secure boot enabled starts up, it checks the digital signatures of the firmware and the bootloader against a list of trusted signing keys stored in the device. If the signatures are valid, the boot process continues, and the operating system is loaded. If any of the signatures are invalid or missing, the boot process is halted to prevent potential security threats.</p>
<p>In this context, secure boot acts as an attestation mechanism, verifying the integrity and authenticity of the firmware, bootloader, and operating system components. It provides a foundational level of trust for the software running on the device, ensuring that only trusted and authorized code is executed during the boot process.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which type of attestation is secure boot? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Secure boot is a form of hardware-based attestation. In this type of attestation, the security checks and verifications are performed by the hardware components of a device, ensuring a high level of trust and integrity.</p>
<p>When secure boot is enabled on a device, the hardware components, such as the firmware and the bootloader, are responsible for verifying the digital signatures of the software components that are loaded during the boot process. The hardware checks these signatures against a list of trusted signing keys stored in the device, providing a secure and tamper-resistant way to ensure that only genuine, trusted software is executed during the boot process.</p>
<p>Since secure boot relies on hardware components to perform these security checks, it is more resilient to software-based attacks and provides a strong foundation for establishing trust in the software running on the device.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What are types of attestation? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Attestation can be broadly classified into two main types: hardware-based attestation and software-based attestation. Both types serve the purpose of verifying the integrity and authenticity of a system, software, or component. Let&rsquo;s look at both types in more detail:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hardware-based attestation:
   In hardware-based attestation, security checks and verifications are performed by the hardware components of a device, ensuring a high level of trust and integrity. Examples of hardware-based attestation include secure boot, Trusted Platform Module (TPM), and Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) attestation. Hardware-based attestation relies on trusted hardware components that are less susceptible to tampering, providing a strong foundation for establishing trust in the software running on the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Software-based attestation:
   Software-based attestation relies on software components to verify the integrity and authenticity of a system, application, or component. This type of attestation typically involves the use of cryptographic techniques, such as digital signatures and certificates, to verify the identity and integrity of the software components being attested. Examples of software-based attestation include remote attestation using digital certificates and mutual authentication using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Shell (SSH). Software-based attestation can provide a reasonable level of security but might be more vulnerable to attacks compared to hardware-based attestation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice, a combination of hardware-based and software-based attestation techniques is often used to provide a comprehensive and robust security solution. The choice of attestation type depends on the specific security requirements, the threat model, and the available hardware and software components of the system.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Are remote or local attestations hardware or software? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Remote and local attestations can be either hardware-based or software-based, depending on the specific implementation and security mechanisms used. These terms primarily describe the scope of the attestation, rather than the underlying technology:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remote attestation:
   Remote attestation involves verifying the identity, integrity, and authenticity of a system, software, or component from a remote location. Typically, remote attestation is performed by a trusted third-party entity or a verifier that communicates with the target device over a network. Remote attestation can use hardware-based mechanisms (e.g., Intel SGX remote attestation) or software-based mechanisms (e.g., attestation based on TLS or digital certificates).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local attestation:
   Local attestation refers to the process of verifying the identity, integrity, and authenticity of a system, software, or component within the same device or a closely connected device. Local attestation often relies on trusted hardware components, like TPMs or secure elements, to provide a high level of trust and security. However, local attestation can also be achieved using software-based mechanisms, such as verifying the integrity of software components through digital signatures or checksums.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, remote and local attestations can be either hardware-based or software-based, depending on the specific implementation and security requirements. The choice between hardware or software attestation depends on factors like the threat model, available resources, and the desired level of security.</p>

<hr />
<h2>MRENCLAVE</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is MRENCLAVE? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>MRENCLAVE is a hash value that represents the identity and code of an enclave in Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions). It is generated during the enclave&rsquo;s creation process and is based on the enclave&rsquo;s content, initial state, and memory layout.</p>
<p>The MRENCLAVE value is calculated as a hash over the enclave&rsquo;s code and data, including its initial register values, memory layout, and other attributes. This hash uniquely identifies the enclave, as even a small change in the code or data would result in a different MRENCLAVE value.</p>
<p>MRENCLAVE is used in various security mechanisms, such as attestation, sealing, and key management, to ensure that the enclave&rsquo;s integrity and authenticity are maintained. It is included in the REPORT data structure, which is used for local and remote attestation processes to prove the identity, integrity, and authenticity of an enclave running on an SGX-enabled platform.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Who generates MRENCLAVE? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>MRENCLAVE is generated by the Intel SGX hardware during the enclave creation process. As the enclave is loaded into memory and initialized, the hardware computes the MRENCLAVE value by hashing the enclave&rsquo;s content, initial state, and memory layout. This ensures that the MRENCLAVE value uniquely represents the identity and integrity of the specific enclave.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Who creates an enclave? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>An enclave is created by the software running on a system that utilizes Intel SGX technology. The application, or a part of it, that wants to use SGX enclaves for secure execution of sensitive code and data initiates the enclave creation process. During this process, the enclave&rsquo;s code, data, and initial state are loaded into the enclave&rsquo;s protected memory region, and the hardware generates the MRENCLAVE value to uniquely represent the enclave.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> So an untrusted software can also create an enclave. Right? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, even untrusted software can create an enclave. The primary purpose of Intel SGX is to allow secure execution of sensitive code and data within an enclave, even if the environment outside the enclave is not trusted. The untrusted software can create an enclave, but it cannot access or tamper with the code and data inside the enclave. Once the enclave is created and initialized, only the trusted code inside the enclave can execute and manipulate the data securely.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I have enclave A and enclave B. How does enclave A know the enclave B before A wants to get MRENCLAVE value of B? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Before enclave A can get the MRENCLAVE value of enclave B, it needs some knowledge about enclave B. Typically, this knowledge is shared through some out-of-band mechanism or by the application that hosts both enclaves. Here&rsquo;s a high-level overview of the process:</p>
<ol>
<li>The application creates enclave A and enclave B.</li>
<li>The application shares some information about enclave B with enclave A. This could be done by passing the targetinfo structure of enclave B to enclave A, which contains the MRENCLAVE value of enclave B.</li>
<li>Enclave A uses the shared information about enclave B to call the EREPORT instruction and generate a report targeting enclave B.</li>
<li>The report generated by enclave A is passed to enclave B, either by the application or through some inter-enclave communication mechanism.</li>
<li>Enclave B verifies the report&rsquo;s authenticity using the EGETKEY instruction to ensure it comes from enclave A. If the report is valid, enclave B can extract the MRENCLAVE value of enclave A from the report.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that the specific implementation details and communication methods may vary depending on the application&rsquo;s design and security requirements. The above steps are a high-level description of the process.</p>
<hr />
<h2>EGETKEY</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is enclave software? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Enclave software refers to a part of an application that runs inside a protected area of memory called an enclave. Enclaves are created using Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) technology to provide a higher level of security for sensitive code and data. The enclave isolates the protected code and data from the rest of the application, the operating system, and other processes running on the same system.</p>
<p>Enclave software is designed to perform specific tasks or process sensitive information while ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and protection against unauthorized access or modification. This can be particularly useful for applications handling sensitive data, such as cryptographic keys, personal information, or proprietary algorithms. By running the sensitive part of the application within an enclave, developers can reduce the attack surface and provide an additional layer of security.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is the EGETKEY instruction only called by enclave software? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the EGETKEY instruction is specific to Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) and is used only by enclave software. EGETKEY is an instruction designed to derive a cryptographic key from a hardware-protected key hierarchy within an enclave. The key derived using EGETKEY is unique to each enclave and is based on the enclave&rsquo;s measurement and identity, providing an additional layer of security.</p>
<p>Enclave software uses the EGETKEY instruction to obtain a secret key for various cryptographic operations, such as encrypting or decrypting sensitive data or for generating a Message Authentication Code (MAC). By using EGETKEY, the key material is kept secure, and the risk of unauthorized access is minimized, since the key is not exposed outside of the enclave.</p>
<p>Only code running inside the enclave is authorized to execute the EGETKEY instruction, ensuring that the derived key remains protected and accessible only to the enclave software.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Can I get hardware-protected key by calling EGETKEY instruction in enclave software? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, by calling the EGETKEY instruction in enclave software, you can obtain a hardware-protected key. This key is derived from a hardware-protected key hierarchy within an enclave, which is part of Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX).</p>
<p>The EGETKEY instruction generates a secret key unique to each enclave based on the enclave&rsquo;s measurement and identity. This provides an added layer of security, ensuring that the key material remains secure and minimizing the risk of unauthorized access. The derived key can then be used for various cryptographic operations, such as encrypting/decrypting sensitive data or generating a Message Authentication Code (MAC).</p>
<p>Keep in mind that only code running inside the enclave is authorized to execute the EGETKEY instruction. This restriction ensures that the derived key remains protected and is accessible only to the enclave software.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> So after I get the hardware-protected key, I can print it. Is it safe? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Printing or logging the hardware-protected key would undermine its security. One of the primary purposes of using a hardware-protected key is to ensure that sensitive data remains secure even in the presence of compromised software or hardware. Exposing the key by printing or logging it outside of the enclave would make it vulnerable to theft and unauthorized access.</p>
<p>If you need to use the hardware-protected key outside of the enclave for some purpose, it is crucial to maintain the key&rsquo;s confidentiality. You should transmit the key securely, ideally using encryption or secure channels, and only share it with trusted parties. Printing or logging the key should be avoided to minimize the risk of exposure.</p>
<hr />
<h2>MRSIGNER</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What does MRSIGNER contain? Please list them? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>MRSIGNER is a value within the Intel SGX architecture that reflects the key or identity of the Sealing Authority that signed the enclave&rsquo;s certificate. It&rsquo;s used for determining access to the sealing key, particularly when using the Sealing Identity policy. In summary, MRSIGNER contains:</p>
<ol>
<li>The identity of the Sealing Authority that signed the enclave&rsquo;s certificate.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is enclave identity? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Enclave identity refers to the unique set of properties that describe and distinguish a specific enclave from others. In the context of Intel SGX, enclave identity is determined by several key attributes, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>MRENCLAVE</strong>: A hash value that represents the enclave&rsquo;s code and data. MRENCLAVE is generated during the enclave&rsquo;s initialization process and is computed using the contents of the enclave memory pages. It helps to verify that the correct enclave code is being executed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MRSIGNER</strong>: A hash value that represents the public key of the entity that signed the enclave. MRSIGNER is generated by hashing the public key used to sign the enclave&rsquo;s signature structure (SIGSTRUCT). This value helps to verify the authenticity of the enclave and establish trust in its signer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ISVSVN</strong>: ISV Security Version Number (ISVSVN) is a version number assigned by the enclave developer to represent the security version of the enclave. It helps to track updates and patches applied to the enclave software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attributes</strong>: A set of properties describing the enclave&rsquo;s behavior, such as whether it allows debugging, its mode of operation, and other security-related properties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enclave measurement</strong>: A value computed based on the enclave&rsquo;s code, data, and configuration. It is used to verify the integrity of the enclave at runtime.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Enclave identity is essential in the attestation process, where a remote party verifies the authenticity and integrity of an enclave running on a different platform. By checking the enclave&rsquo;s identity against known and trusted values, the remote party can establish trust in the enclave and safely communicate or share sensitive information with it.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How to generate MRSIGNER? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>MRSIGNER is a hash value that represents the public key of the entity that signed the enclave. To generate MRSIGNER, you need to follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Generate a key pair: Create a public-private key pair using an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm such as RSA or ECDSA. The private key will be used to sign the enclave, while the public key will be used to verify the signature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a signature structure (SIGSTRUCT): The signature structure contains information about the enclave, such as MRENCLAVE, attributes, and other metadata. It also includes the signature created using the private key from step 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sign the SIGSTRUCT: Use the private key from step 1 to sign the SIGSTRUCT. The signature will be included in the SIGSTRUCT itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate MRSIGNER: Compute the hash of the public key from step 1 using a cryptographic hash function like SHA-256. The resulting hash value is the MRSIGNER.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that MRSIGNER is generated during the enclave signing process, which is typically done by the enclave developer or an independent software vendor (ISV) using tools provided by the SGX SDK. Once the enclave is signed and MRSIGNER is generated, it is used in the attestation process to verify the authenticity of the enclave and establish trust in the entity that signed it.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is MRSIGNER only one? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>MRSIGNER is not unique to every enclave; it is unique to the entity that signed the enclave. Multiple enclaves signed by the same entity (using the same public-private key pair) will have the same MRSIGNER value.</p>
<p>In other words, MRSIGNER is a way to identify the signer of an enclave rather than the enclave itself. When you verify an enclave&rsquo;s identity during the remote attestation process, you may use the MRSIGNER to check if the enclave was signed by a trusted entity.</p>
<p>For example, if a company produces multiple enclaves, they may sign all their enclaves with the same key pair. All these enclaves will have the same MRSIGNER, which represents the company&rsquo;s public key. In this case, MRSIGNER serves as an identifier for the company as the enclave signer.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Where to save the private key generated in the process of generating MRSIGNER? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>When generating an MRSIGNER value, you use a private key to sign the enclave. This private key should be stored securely to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of your enclave software. Here are some best practices for storing private keys:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hardware Security Module (HSM): Use a dedicated hardware device designed to manage cryptographic keys securely. HSMs provide strong protection against unauthorized access and tampering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key Management System (KMS): Use a centralized key management system that offers secure key storage, access control, and key lifecycle management. Cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure offer KMS solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure storage on a trusted machine: Store the private key on a secure, trusted machine with restricted access. Ensure that the machine is protected with strong encryption and access control mechanisms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encrypted storage: Encrypt the private key before storing it on a secure file system or database. Only grant access to the encrypted key to authorized personnel or applications.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless of the storage method you choose, ensure that you follow best practices for key management, such as regular key rotation, secure key backup, and access control. Also, consider implementing a robust auditing and monitoring system to track the usage of the private key and detect any unauthorized access attempts.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Who can write MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER are values that are generated and populated by the Intel SGX hardware during the enclave creation process.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>MRENCLAVE: This value is a measurement (hash) of the enclave&rsquo;s code and data. It is generated by the hardware when the enclave is being built and loaded into memory. The MRENCLAVE value is a result of hashing the enclave&rsquo;s content during the build process, and it represents the identity of the specific enclave. No one writes MRENCLAVE directly; it is produced by the hardware as a part of the enclave creation process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MRSIGNER: This value is a measurement (hash) of the public key of the Sealing Authority, which is responsible for signing the enclave&rsquo;s certificate. MRSIGNER is populated by the hardware when the enclave is loaded into memory and is derived from the enclave&rsquo;s signature. The Sealing Authority generates the key pair used for signing the enclave, and during the enclave loading process, the hardware calculates the MRSIGNER value from the public key in the enclave&rsquo;s signature. This value represents the identity of the Sealing Authority.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER are not written by any individual or entity directly; instead, they are generated and populated by the Intel SGX hardware during the enclave creation and loading process.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Only hardware can write the both registers. Right? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s correct. Only the Intel SGX hardware can write both MRENCLAVE and MRSIGNER registers. These values are generated and populated by the hardware during the enclave creation and loading process, ensuring that they are secure and trustworthy.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Sealing Identity</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is Sealing Identity? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The Sealing Identity is a set of criteria in Intel SGX that determines which enclaves can access a specific Sealing Key. These criteria help control the accessibility of sensitive data to future versions of an enclave.</p>
<p>When an enclave needs to store sensitive data securely outside the enclave, it uses the Sealing Key to encrypt and integrity-protect the data. The Sealing Identity specifies the conditions under which a later instantiation of an enclave can access this Sealing Key and decrypt the sealed data.</p>
<p>Intel SGX supports two policies for Sealing Identity:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sealing to the Enclave Identity: This policy bases the Sealing Key on the MRENCLAVE value (the measurement of the enclave&rsquo;s initial state). The key is available to any instance of the exact enclave, and future software versions cannot access the secrets of the original enclave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sealing to the Sealing Authority Identity (Sealing Identity): This policy bases the Sealing Key on the MRSIGNER value (the measurement of the enclave&rsquo;s signing authority) and the enclave&rsquo;s version. It allows newer enclaves signed by the same Sealing Authority to access data stored by previous versions, enabling data migration between enclave versions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the Sealing Identity determines which enclaves can access the Sealing Key based on the selected policy, either by restricting access to the same enclave version or allowing access to newer enclave versions signed by the same Sealing Authority.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is &ldquo;Sealing Identity&rdquo; a MRSIGNER? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Sealing Identity is not the same as MRSIGNER. However, MRSIGNER is a part of the Sealing Identity. Sealing Identity is a policy used when invoking EGETKEY in Intel® SGX to determine which enclaves can access a sealing key. The Sealing Identity policy is based on the enclave&rsquo;s MRSIGNER value (identity of the Sealing Authority) and the enclave&rsquo;s version. This policy allows for data migration between different versions of enclaves signed by the same Sealing Authority.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Coud I say that SIGSTRUCT is Sealing Identity? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>No, SIGSTRUCT and Sealing Identity are not the same thing. SIGSTRUCT is a data structure that contains the enclave&rsquo;s measurement (MRENCLAVE), the signer&rsquo;s measurement (MRSIGNER), and other metadata related to the enclave, including the signature of the enclave created by the Sealing Authority.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Sealing Identity is a concept that refers to the criteria or policy used to determine which enclaves may access the sealing key generated by the EGETKEY instruction. It is either based on the enclave&rsquo;s identity (MRENCLAVE) or the identity of the Sealing Authority (MRSIGNER).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the value of Sealing Identity in the paper? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>In the paper, the Sealing Identity refers to the criteria or policy used to determine which enclaves may access the sealing key generated by the EGETKEY instruction. Intel® SGX supports two policies for Seal Keys:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sealing to the Enclave Identity: This policy is based on the enclave&rsquo;s MRENCLAVE. Any change that impacts the enclave&rsquo;s measurement will yield a different key. This results in a different key for each enclave, providing full isolation between enclaves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sealing to the Sealing Identity: This policy is based on the enclave&rsquo;s MRSIGNER and the enclave&rsquo;s version. MRSIGNER reflects the key/identity of the Sealing Authority that signed the enclave&rsquo;s certificate. This allows offline migration of sealed data between enclave versions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The actual value of the Sealing Identity will depend on which policy is chosen and the specific enclave measurements involved.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the value of Sealing Identity in the policy &ldquo;Sealing to the Enclave Identity&rdquo; in the paper? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>In the policy &ldquo;Sealing to the Enclave Identity,&rdquo; the value of the Sealing Identity is based on the enclave&rsquo;s MRENCLAVE. MRENCLAVE is a unique value that represents the measurement of the enclave&rsquo;s code and data. Any change that impacts the enclave&rsquo;s measurement will yield a different MRENCLAVE value. Thus, the Sealing Identity in this case would be the MRENCLAVE value of the enclave.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Sealing Authority</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is Sealing Authority? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The Sealing Authority is an entity responsible for signing and endorsing enclaves in the context of Intel SGX. It is typically the enclave developer or an organization that signs and vouches for the integrity and authenticity of the enclave software. The Sealing Authority signs enclaves using its private key, and the corresponding public key is embedded within the enclave to verify its authenticity.</p>
<p>When sealing data to a Sealing Authority Identity (Sealing Identity), the Sealing Key is based on the MRSIGNER value (the measurement of the enclave&rsquo;s signing authority) and the enclave&rsquo;s version. This policy allows newer enclaves signed by the same Sealing Authority to access data stored by previous versions, enabling data migration between enclave versions and ensuring that only trusted and authenticated enclaves can access sensitive data.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is Sealing Authority a software or a hardware? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>I apologize for any confusion in my previous response. The Sealing Authority is not a specific piece of software or hardware; it refers to the entity responsible for signing enclaves. This entity could be an individual developer, a company, or an organization. They use software tools and cryptographic techniques to sign enclaves, ensuring their authenticity and integrity.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is Sealing Authority a enclave builder? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the Sealing Authority can be considered as the enclave builder or the entity responsible for creating and signing enclaves. The Sealing Authority has the necessary cryptographic keys to sign the enclave&rsquo;s certificate, which in turn establishes trust in the enclave&rsquo;s identity and authenticity. The MRSIGNER value reflects the identity of the Sealing Authority, and it is used in sealing policies to determine which enclaves can access the same sealing keys, enabling them to transparently access data that was sealed by other enclaves under the authority&rsquo;s control.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is difference between Sealing Identity and Identity of the Sealing Authority? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The Sealing Identity and the Identity of the Sealing Authority are related but not the same.</p>
<p>Sealing Identity refers to the policy used when invoking the EGETKEY instruction in Intel® SGX to determine which enclaves can access a sealing key. The Sealing Identity is based on the enclave&rsquo;s MRSIGNER value and the enclave&rsquo;s version. This policy allows for data migration between different versions of enclaves signed by the same Sealing Authority.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Identity of the Sealing Authority is represented by the MRSIGNER value, which reflects the key or identity of the authority that signed the enclave&rsquo;s certificate. The Sealing Authority is responsible for signing enclaves and determining which enclaves can access the same seal key, enabling them to transparently access data that was sealed by other enclaves under their authority.</p>
<p>In summary, the Sealing Identity is a policy based on the MRSIGNER and enclave version, while the Identity of the Sealing Authority is represented by the MRSIGNER value itself.</p>
<hr />
<h2>SIGSTRUCT</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Who does prepare SIGSTRUCT? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>SIGSTRUCT is prepared by the enclave developer or the entity responsible for creating the enclave. This entity, sometimes called the Sealing Authority, generates the SIGSTRUCT as part of the enclave building process. They sign the enclave with their private key, which is then verified by the Intel SGX hardware using the public key (MRSIGNER) to ensure the enclave&rsquo;s authenticity and integrity.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What does SIGSTRUCT contain? please list them. <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>SIGSTRUCT is a data structure in Intel SGX that contains the enclave&rsquo;s signature, which is generated by the enclave author or builder during the enclave signing process. The SIGSTRUCT contains the following fields:</p>
<ol>
<li>Header: A constant value identifying the SIGSTRUCT.</li>
<li>Vendor: Indicates whether the enclave is a debug or production enclave.</li>
<li>Date: The date when the enclave was created.</li>
<li>Header2: A constant value representing the second part of the header.</li>
<li>SWDefined: Software-defined field, reserved for future use.</li>
<li>Reserved1: Reserved field for padding.</li>
<li>Modulus: The RSA public key modulus (n) of the enclave signer.</li>
<li>Exponent: The RSA public key exponent (e) of the enclave signer.</li>
<li>Signature: The RSA signature of the enclave, generated using the enclave signer&rsquo;s private key.</li>
<li>MiscSelect: A set of flags indicating which additional information should be included in the enclave measurement.</li>
<li>MiscMask: A mask for the MiscSelect field.</li>
<li>Reserved2: Reserved field for padding.</li>
<li>Attributes: Flags describing various enclave properties.</li>
<li>AttributeMask: A mask for the Attributes field.</li>
<li>EnclaveHash: The MRENCLAVE value, which is the hash of the enclave&rsquo;s initial state.</li>
<li>Reserved3: Reserved field for padding.</li>
<li>ISVProdID: The Product ID of the enclave.</li>
<li>ISVSVN: The Security Version Number (SVN) of the enclave.</li>
<li>Reserved4: Reserved field for padding.</li>
<li>Q1, Q2: Two values used in the RSA signature generation process.</li>
</ol>
<p>These fields are used by the Intel SGX hardware to verify the integrity and authenticity of the enclave during the enclave loading process.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Attestation Assertion</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Who produces attestation assertion? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>In the context of Intel SGX, the attestation assertion is produced by the enclave software running on the hardware. The enclave generates a data structure called a quote, which contains the attestation information, including the measurement of the enclave (MRENCLAVE) and the enclave&rsquo;s identity. The quote is then typically sent to a remote party (verifier) who evaluates the attestation assertion to determine if they trust the enclave and its execution environment. In some cases, an additional step is involved where the quote is sent to the Intel Attestation Service, which returns a signed attestation report that the verifier can then use to verify the enclave&rsquo;s authenticity.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Attestation Key</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is attestation key? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>An attestation key is a cryptographic key used in the process of attestation to prove the authenticity and integrity of a system, software, or hardware component. The attestation key is typically an asymmetric key pair, consisting of a private key and a public key.</p>
<p>In the context of secure enclaves or trusted execution environments like Intel SGX, the attestation key is used to sign data, such as measurements or claims about the secure environment, to provide a proof that the data is genuine and has not been tampered with. The private attestation key is kept securely within the enclave, while the public key is used by a verifier or remote party to validate the signature and ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data.</p>
<p>Attestation keys play a critical role in establishing trust in systems, as they provide a strong cryptographic guarantee that the information being attested to is genuine and originates from a trusted source.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there only one attestation key in a device? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>In a device that supports hardware-based attestation, there can be multiple attestation keys depending on the specific technology being used and the device&rsquo;s intended purposes. For example, with Intel SGX, a device can have multiple enclaves, each with its own set of keys for secure operations.</p>
<p>In the case of TPM (Trusted Platform Module), a single device can have multiple attestation keys, each with a different purpose. For instance, there may be separate keys for platform configuration, software integrity, and user identity. These keys can be generated on-demand by the TPM and securely stored within the module.</p>
<p>In summary, a device can have more than one attestation key depending on the specific attestation technology being used and the device&rsquo;s security requirements.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Where is attestation key sotred in Intel SGX arch? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>In the Intel SGX architecture, the attestation key is not stored directly on the platform. Instead, the hardware-protected enclave generates an ephemeral attestation key pair during the attestation process.</p>
<p>The private attestation key is created and kept within the enclave, and it is not accessible by any other software or hardware outside the enclave. The public part of the attestation key pair is included in the attestation report, which is then sent to a remote party for verification.</p>
<p>The attestation process also involves the use of Intel&rsquo;s Enhanced Privacy ID (EPID), which is a group signature scheme that provides anonymity and revocability. The EPID private key is embedded in the processor during manufacturing and is securely stored inside the processor. The corresponding EPID group public key is maintained by Intel, allowing verification of EPID signatures.</p>
<p>To summarize, the attestation keys in Intel SGX are stored as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ephemeral attestation key pair: Generated within the enclave during the attestation process. The private key is kept inside the enclave, while the public key is included in the attestation report.</li>
<li>EPID private key: Embedded in the processor during manufacturing and securely stored inside the processor.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>EREPORT</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What does REPORT contain? Please list them? <code>(2023-04-19)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>A REPORT in Intel SGX is a data structure that contains information about an enclave, attesting its identity and integrity. The main components of a REPORT include:</p>
<ol>
<li>MRENCLAVE: A hash representing the enclave&rsquo;s identity and code. It is generated during enclave creation and depends on the enclave&rsquo;s content and initial state.</li>
<li>MRSIGNER: A hash of the public key of the enclave&rsquo;s signer, which represents the identity of the Sealing Authority or enclave developer.</li>
<li>ISVPRODID: The product ID assigned by the enclave developer.</li>
<li>ISVSVN: The security version number assigned by the enclave developer, representing the security-related version or patch level of the enclave.</li>
<li>REPORTDATA: A user-defined data field, which can be used to store additional information, such as a challenge-response for the remote attestation process.</li>
<li>ATTRIBUTES: Flags indicating properties of the enclave, such as its access permissions, execution modes, or other relevant characteristics.</li>
<li>CPU_SVN: A value representing the security version number of the CPU and microcode.</li>
<li>MiscSelect: A value specifying the set of miscellaneous properties to include in the measurement.</li>
<li>Timestamp: The time at which the REPORT was generated by the CPU.</li>
</ol>
<p>The REPORT is used as a part of the local and remote attestation processes to prove the identity, integrity, and authenticity of an enclave running on an SGX-enabled platform.</p>
<hr />
<h2>EPID:</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is EPID? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>EPID (Enhanced Privacy ID) is a privacy-enhancing technology developed by Intel for anonymous attestation of trusted computing platforms. It is primarily used in Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions) to verify the authenticity and integrity of an enclave without revealing the identity of the platform.</p>
<p>EPID enables a group signature scheme that allows a platform to prove its membership in a group without revealing its individual identity. This allows for anonymous attestation, where a service provider can verify that a platform is genuine and running trusted enclave software without needing to know the specific identity of the platform. This helps protect user privacy and reduces the risk of tracking or linking activities back to individual users.</p>
<p>EPID is particularly useful in scenarios where privacy is essential, such as in cloud computing or IoT environments, where platforms may need to attest their trustworthiness to remote service providers without revealing their unique identities.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How does EPID work? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>EPID (Enhanced Privacy ID) is a group signature scheme developed by Intel, which allows anonymous attestation for Intel SGX-enabled platforms. It provides privacy-preserving remote attestation, meaning the verifier cannot link the attestation to a specific device or user. The key principles of EPID are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Anonymous credentials: Each platform receives a unique private key that is part of a group, and the corresponding public key represents the group. When an attestation is performed, it&rsquo;s not possible to determine which platform or user was involved, only that the platform belongs to the group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issuer: A trusted authority (Intel, in the case of SGX) issues the credentials to the platforms. The issuer creates the group public key and a private key for each platform in the group. The issuer signs the credentials and ensures the platforms receive their private keys securely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revocation: The issuer can revoke credentials for individual platforms if required (e.g., when a security vulnerability is discovered). Revocation lists are distributed to verifiers, who can then reject attestations from revoked platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signature generation: When a platform wants to attest to its identity, it creates a signature using its EPID private key and the message (typically a quote from an enclave) to be signed. The signature proves that the platform belongs to the group without revealing its specific identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signature verification: The verifier checks the signature using the group public key and the revocation list. If the signature is valid and the platform&rsquo;s credentials haven&rsquo;t been revoked, the verifier accepts the attestation as genuine.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, EPID enables privacy-preserving remote attestation for Intel SGX-enabled platforms by using anonymous group signatures. The verifier can confirm that the platform is part of a trusted group without being able to link the attestation to a specific device or user.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Which problems does EPID solve? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>EPID (Enhanced Privacy ID) solves several problems related to remote attestation and device identity management, particularly for Intel SGX-enabled platforms. Some of the key problems EPID addresses are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Privacy: Traditional attestation schemes can potentially reveal the identity of the device or user, which may lead to privacy concerns. EPID utilizes anonymous group signatures to ensure that the verifier can only determine that the attesting platform belongs to a trusted group, without revealing the specific identity of the device or user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scalability: In scenarios where a large number of devices require attestation, managing individual public keys for each device can be cumbersome. EPID simplifies this by using a single group public key for all devices within a group. This allows verifiers to validate attestations using a single public key, making the process more scalable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revocation: EPID provides an efficient mechanism to revoke the credentials of compromised or vulnerable devices. The issuer maintains a revocation list that allows verifiers to reject attestations from revoked platforms. This helps maintain the security and trust of the attestation process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Device onboarding: EPID allows for a smoother and more secure onboarding process for new devices. The trusted authority (e.g., Intel) issues credentials for each device, ensuring that they receive their private keys securely. This helps streamline device provisioning and management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interoperability: EPID can be integrated into various attestation protocols and systems, promoting interoperability between different devices, platforms, and services. It can be used in conjunction with other security mechanisms, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or secure boot, to create secure communication channels and establish trust.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, EPID addresses key challenges in remote attestation, device identity management, and privacy. It helps create a more secure and scalable system for verifying the trustworthiness of devices and protecting user privacy.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How do I make sure that the EPID issuer doesn&rsquo;t retain private keys? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>To ensure that the EPID issuer doesn&rsquo;t retain private keys, you can implement a few strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use a Trusted Third Party (TTP): Instead of relying on the EPID issuer to generate private keys, you can employ a TTP to issue the private keys to devices. The TTP can be an independent entity that all parties trust, ensuring that the EPID issuer doesn&rsquo;t have access to the private keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generate keys on the device: One way to prevent the EPID issuer from retaining private keys is by generating the keys directly on the device itself. This can be done using a hardware-based secure element or a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to generate and securely store the private key. By doing this, the private key never leaves the device, ensuring that the EPID issuer doesn&rsquo;t have access to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zero-knowledge proofs: Zero-knowledge proofs can be used to prove the validity of a private key without revealing the key itself. This can help ensure that the EPID issuer doesn&rsquo;t have access to the private keys while still being able to verify their authenticity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Audits and transparency: Regular audits and transparency reports can help build trust between the EPID issuer and the devices. By allowing third-party audits of their key management practices and infrastructure, the EPID issuer can demonstrate that they do not retain private keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legal and contractual agreements: Establishing legal and contractual agreements between the EPID issuer and the device manufacturers or users can help define the responsibilities and limitations of the issuer. These agreements can include clauses that prohibit the issuer from retaining private keys and specify penalties for non-compliance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, ensuring that the EPID issuer doesn&rsquo;t retain private keys requires a combination of technical and procedural measures, along with trust-building mechanisms like audits and legal agreements.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How does EPID revoke a compromised device? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>EPID (Enhanced Privacy ID) revocation works through the use of revocation lists, specifically the Group Revocation List (GRL) and the Private Key-Based Revocation List (PRL). When a device is compromised or its private key is deemed insecure, its identifier (member ID or private key-based identifier) is added to one of these lists. This process ensures that the compromised device will no longer be considered valid during the attestation process.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an overview of how EPID revocation works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Detection of compromise: The first step is identifying that a device or its private key has been compromised. This can be done through monitoring, reporting, or other means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding the identifier to the revocation list: Once a device is identified as compromised, its identifier (member ID or private key-based identifier) is added to the appropriate revocation list (GRL or PRL).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distribution of revocation lists: The revocation lists are periodically updated and distributed to relying parties, such as service providers and verifiers, who need to validate the authenticity of devices during attestation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attestation process: During the attestation process, the device generates a signature using its private key and EPID parameters. The verifier checks the signature against the public parameters and the revocation lists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verification and revocation: If the device&rsquo;s identifier is found in a revocation list, the verifier will consider the attestation invalid, effectively revoking the device&rsquo;s access to services or data. If the device&rsquo;s identifier is not in any revocation list, the verifier will proceed with the attestation process and grant access accordingly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, EPID revokes a compromised device by adding its identifier to a revocation list, which is then distributed to relying parties. During the attestation process, the device&rsquo;s signature is checked against the revocation lists, and if it&rsquo;s found on a list, the attestation is considered invalid, effectively revoking the device&rsquo;s access to services or data.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How to get the EPID of the compromised device? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>To get the EPID (Enhanced Privacy ID) of a compromised device, you&rsquo;ll typically need to follow an incident response process to gather information about the device, its security status, and potential threats. Here&rsquo;s a general outline of the steps you should take:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Incident detection: The first step is to detect a potential security incident or compromise involving the device. This can be done through monitoring systems, alerts, or reports from users or administrators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incident investigation: Once you&rsquo;ve detected a potential compromise, you need to investigate the incident to determine the cause, scope, and impact. This may involve analyzing logs, network traffic, and other relevant data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Device identification: During the investigation, you&rsquo;ll need to identify the specific device(s) involved in the incident. This may involve correlating information from logs, network traffic, or other sources to pinpoint the affected device(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collecting device information: Once you&rsquo;ve identified the compromised device, collect relevant information about it, such as the serial number, hardware and software configurations, and any unique identifiers, like EPID parameters or other security-related data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifying the EPID: With the collected device information, identify the device&rsquo;s EPID by analyzing its EPID parameters (e.g., member ID or private key-based identifier). This may require accessing the device directly or working with the device manufacturer or platform provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revoking the EPID: Once you have the EPID of the compromised device, you can add it to the appropriate revocation list (Group Revocation List or Private Key-Based Revocation List) to revoke its access to services or data during the attestation process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that the specific steps and processes may vary depending on the device type, platform, and organization&rsquo;s incident response procedures. It&rsquo;s crucial to have a well-defined incident response plan in place to ensure an efficient and effective response to security incidents.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> But if the compromised device reports a fake EPID, what should I do? <code>(2023-04-18)</code></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>If a compromised device is suspected of reporting a fake EPID, there are several steps you can take to mitigate the risk and verify the authenticity of the device:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Verify attestation reports: When using remote attestation, check the attestation reports provided by the device to ensure they are genuine and have been signed by a trusted attestation service. This can help detect fake EPIDs by verifying the signature, certificate chain, and the data contained within the report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor for anomalous behavior: Continuously monitor the behavior of devices and their network communications. Look for unusual patterns or activities that could indicate a compromised device or the use of a fake EPID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS): Use IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic and detect potential threats, such as attempts to use fake EPIDs or unauthorized access to sensitive data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement strong authentication and access controls: Ensure that devices are required to authenticate themselves using strong methods, such as multi-factor authentication, before they can access sensitive data or services. This can help prevent unauthorized access by compromised devices using fake EPIDs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regularly update and patch software: Keep the software on devices up-to-date and apply security patches promptly to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities being exploited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct regular security assessments and audits: Perform regular security assessments and audits to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities in your environment. This can help uncover compromised devices and attempts to use fake EPIDs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish and enforce security policies: Develop and implement security policies that define the acceptable use of devices, outline the responsibilities of users and administrators, and specify the requirements for reporting and responding to security incidents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Train users and administrators: Provide regular training and awareness programs to educate users and administrators about the risks of compromised devices and the use of fake EPIDs. This can help ensure that they are better prepared to detect and respond to potential threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborate with vendors and partners: Work closely with device manufacturers, platform providers, and other partners to share information about potential threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices for detecting and mitigating the risk of compromised devices and fake EPIDs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In case a fake EPID is detected, follow your organization&rsquo;s incident response plan to contain the threat, investigate the issue, and recover from the incident.</p>
